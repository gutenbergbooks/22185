<h2><a name="sonnie" id="sonnie"></a>SONNIE-BOY'S PEOPLE</h2>


<p>The man with the gold-headed cane had been
headed for the cottage, but espying the boy
at the water's edge, he changed his course. He
crept to within a few paces of the lad before he
hailed: "Halloo, little boy! I'll bet I know who
your papa is."</p>

<p>The boy looked casually around. Seeing that
it was a stranger, he faced about and stood respectfully
erect.</p>

<p>"Mr. Welkie's little boy, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But I'm 'most six."</p>

<p>"Oh-h, I see&mdash;a big boy now. But what have
you got there?"</p>

<p>The boy held up the toy steamer with which
he had been playing.</p>

<p>"Oh-h, I see now. What are you going to do
with it?"</p>

<p>The boy looked sidewise out to where in the bay
a fleet of battle-ships were lying to anchor.</p>

<p>"Load it with sugar and pineapples, and ship
'em to the States, are you?"
<span class='pagenum'>[4]</span></p>

<p>"But it's a gun-ship. See&mdash;where the turrets
'n' the fighting-tops will be when papa makes
them."</p>

<p>"Oh! and so you want to be a great merchant?"</p>

<p>"I want to be a fighter"&mdash;articulating slowly
and distinctly&mdash;"on a big gun-ship."</p>

<p>"Well, if ever you do, little man, I'll bet you'll
be a game one, too. Is your papa home?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, but Aunt Marie is."</p>

<p>"And is Aunt Marie busy, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir, but she's making a battle-flag
for my gun-ship."</p>

<p>"That so? I think I will call on Aunt Marie,
then."</p>

<p>Swinging his cane and advancing leisurely, the
stranger headed for the screened veranda door.</p>

<p>Marie Welkie, because of having to keep an eye
on her nephew from the veranda, could not avoid
noticing the stranger. The clothing, the jewelry,
the air of assurance, had disturbed and half amused
her; but the kindly tone with the boy, the parting
pat of his head, were more pleasing. She answered
his knock herself.</p>

<p>"Good evening&mdash;Miss Welkie?" That Southern
"good evening" in the middle of the afternoon
likewise pleased her.</p>

<p>"Miss Welkie, yes."</p>

<p>"I'm Mr. Necker." From a gold-mounted case
<span class='pagenum'>[5]</span>
he drew out a card. "I'm looking for your
brother."</p>

<p>"He won't be home for some time yet. But
won't you step in, Mr. Necker, from out of the
sun?"</p>

<p>"Thank you. It is warm, isn't it? Warmer
than ordinary?"</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't say so. It's usually hot here."</p>

<p>"Then it must be hot here when it is hot. It
wasn't so bad out in the Gulf. I just got in&mdash;from
Key West. Not many passengers come here,
Miss Welkie?"</p>

<p>"Only somebody especially interested in the
works&mdash;usually from Washington. Do you mind
if I go ahead with this ensign for my nephew, Mr.
Necker?" She held up a partly finished American
ensign. Above the top of it the visitor could
see part of the very white forehead and a front of
dark straight hair. "I promised to have it ready
for my nephew surely by morning, and after my
brother gets home there probably won't be much
spare time. But were you the only passenger for
here, Mr. Necker?"</p>

<p>"There was one other. He got off at the new
fortification landing. Twenty-nine or thirty perhaps
he was&mdash;a well-made, easy-moving kind."
His voice was casual, but his gaze was keen
enough. It never left her face. "A tall man
<span class='pagenum'>[6]</span>
came running down to meet him," he resumed.
"They seemed terribly glad to see each other."</p>

<p>"That must have been my brother to meet&mdash;Mr.
Balfe, was it?&mdash;your fellow-passenger."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment. "Mr. Balfe&mdash;yes,
that was it. The captain&mdash;or was it the captain?&mdash;said
that there was a Mr. Balfe who went on
special missions for the government, but whether
this was the Mr. Balfe or not he could not say."</p>

<p>She sewed serenely on. "I've heard that that
steamer captain is developing into a great gossip.
Our Mr. Balfe is my brother's dearest friend and
godfather to my brother's boy&mdash;the boy you were
speaking to on the beach&mdash;and if he ever found
himself in this part of the world without calling
on us, I don't know what my brother would
think."</p>

<p>This time Miss Welkie looked up, and Necker
smiled with her. Also he peered smilingly through
the veranda vine. "So that is your brother's boy
out there? Well, well! And a fine boy, too! A
beautifully shaped head. Bright, I'll bet?"</p>

<p>"Naturally"&mdash;with a tender smile&mdash;"we think
so."</p>

<p>"I'll bet he is. And of course your brother is
laying great plans to assure his future?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are not well acquainted with
my brother, Mr. Necker."</p>

&quot;" title="" /> <span class="caption">&quot;And of course your brother is
laying great plans to assure his future?&quot;</span>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[7]</span></p>

<p>"Not personally, Miss Welkie, but surely he
won't neglect his own child's future?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that would not be his way of looking
at it."</p>

<p>"And his way is a fine way, no doubt, Miss
Welkie&mdash;if a man had only himself to think of.
But can, or should, his family&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>"His family? Young Greg and I are his family,
Mr. Necker, and I'm sure we're not worrying
about the future." Her head bent lower to her
sewing, but not too low for Necker to see the little
smile, half of humor, half of something else, hovering
on her lips.</p>

<p>"Because you're too young&mdash;and too unselfish."</p>

<p>This time her head came up and the smile developed
into a soft laugh. "No, no, nothing quite
so fine as that, nor quite so awfully young. At
twenty-three&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Necker tried to meet her eyes; but the eyes were
not for him, nor for the boy on the beach this time,
nor for the brave war-ships at anchor. Her eyes
were for something farther away. Necker, twisting
in his chair, could distinguish through the haze
the fortification walls on the other side of the little
bay.</p>

<p>There was another little smile hovering. Necker
waited hopefully. She, catching his eye, flushed
and returned to her sewing. "We're all very
<span class='pagenum'>[8]</span>
happy here," she added after a moment, and, still
flushing, resumed her needle.</p>

<p>Presently he pointed his cane at the boy on the
beach. "A great deal of your brother in him,
isn't there?"</p>

<p>"Very much. Our older friends back home say
that it is like Greg&mdash;that is, my brother&mdash;being
born all over."</p>

<p>"A fine boy, yes, Miss Welkie, and ought to be
a great man some day. But I'll be running along
now, Miss Welkie."</p>

<p>"You won't wait for him? He will be glad to
see you, I know."</p>

<p>"Thank you; but after a man's been out there
under that sun all day is no time for a friend to
bother him. And I am a friend of your brother's,
believe me, Miss Welkie. It is because I am a
friend and an admirer of his that I'm here."</p>

<p>"But you will return later?"</p>

<p>"I will, thank you&mdash;after he's had time to clean
up and eat and smoke, and a chat with his friend,
I'll drop in for a little talk, and in that little talk,
Miss Welkie, I hope you won't be against me, for
I mean it for his best. So until eight o'clock
to-night, Miss Welkie&mdash;<i>adios</i>." Necker, swishing
his gold-headed cane, strolled leisurely away.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he wants of Greg," murmured
Marie Welkie. And until his pea-green suit was
<span class='pagenum'>[9]</span>
lost to sight she speculated on his probable
errand.</p>

<p>By and by her eyes, now less speculative, detected
the smudge against the concrete walls. She
took down a pair of glasses from the wall. It was the
towboat leaving the wharf. The glasses took the
place of her sewing, and they were still to her eyes
when a sharp "Auntie!" came to her ears. "Tention,
auntie! Colors!" warned the voice. Lowering
the glasses, Marie came obediently to attention.</p>

<p>The sun was cutting the edge of the sea. The
last level light lay on the long, slow, swelling
waters like a rolling, flaming carpet, and in that
flaming path the gray war-ships bobbed to anchor;
and on the quarter-deck of every ship a red-coated
band was drawn up, and from the jack-staff
of every ship an American ensign was slowly
dropping down. The boy stood with his back to
her, but Marie knew how his heart was thumping,
and she knew the light that would be on his face.</p>

<p>"O say! can you see&mdash;" came the swelling notes
over the gently heaving bay. Marie could feel
that young Greg was ready to burst; but she
could not detect a move, not a quiver, out of him
until the last note of the last bugle had ceased to
re-echo. Then he saluted reverently, executed an
about-face, and called out excitedly: "Auntie,
auntie, there's papa now! Look!"
<span class='pagenum'>[10]</span></p>

<p>Marie pretended to see for the first time the
towboat which, a hundred yards or so down the
beach, was making a landing. "Sure enough,
Greg!"</p>

<p>"And somebody else!"</p>

<p>"No; is there?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see&mdash;godfather, auntie! O
papa! Godfather!" He was off.</p>

<p>When he returned he was clinging on the one
hand to a tall, brown, lean-cheeked, and rather
slender man of thirty four or five, in dusty corduroy
coat and trousers, mud-caked shoes and leggings,
khaki shirt, and a hard-looking, low-blocked
Panama hat; and on the other hand to a man also
sun-tanned, but less tall and not so lean&mdash;a muscular,
active man who may have lived the thirty
years which Necker ascribed to him, but who
surely did not look it now. At sight of Marie
Welkie stepping down from the screened veranda
he bounded like sixteen years across the beach.
"Marie Welkie&mdash;at last!"</p>

<p>"Andie Balfe!" She took his hands within hers
and drew them up in front of her bosom. The
smile which Necker had so wanted to see again
was there now, and now not to vanish in a moment.
Balfe brushed her finger tips with his lips.</p>

<p>"How far this time, Andie?"</p>

<p>"From half the world around, Marie."
<span class='pagenum'>[11]</span></p>

<p>"And are you glad?"</p>

<p>"And I would come it twice again to see your
dear eyes smile."</p>

<p>"Could eyes be made so dull as not to light to
your poetic touch, Andie?" And then, in a low
voice, "Wait for the sunset." She stood upon her
toes for her brother's kiss. "Another hard, hot
day, Greg?"</p>

<p>"No, no, a fine day, Marie. Pedro"&mdash;he motioned
to the negro at their rear&mdash;"put Mr.
Balfe's suit-case in the corner of the veranda
there. That'll be all to-night, except to see that
Mr. Balfe's trunks come up from the towboat."</p>

<p>He paused on the veranda steps to get a view of
the bay. As he stood there in silence, the lively
notes of a dozen buglers came sharply to them.
He still held the boy's hand.</p>

<p>"Mess call, papa?"</p>

<p>"Getting so you know them all, aren't you,
Sonnie-Boy? One minute from now ten thousand
husky lads out there will be doing awful things to
the commissary grub. But look there! Andie,
did any of your kings or presidents ever offer you
sights more gorgeous than that to view from their
palace walls?"</p>

<p>It was the afterglow of the sunset, a red-and-orange
glory fading into the blue-black velvet of a
Caribbean twilight.
<span class='pagenum'>[12]</span></p>

<p>"It's by way of greeting to the far traveller.
This may be the last place on earth here, Andie,
but we warrant our sunsets to be the best on the
market. But let's go inside and make ready to
eat. What do you say, Sonnie-Boy?"</p>

<p>"But, papa, you said that when godfather
came you would have the Little Men sing you a
song for the steam-engine he sent me from Japan!"</p>

<p>"That's right, I did. But where is it?"</p>

<p>"Right here, papa." From the veranda corner
he picked up a toy locomotive. "Look! <i>Lightning</i>,
I've named it."</p>

<p>"A fine name for it, too. Well, let me see.
How was it? Oh, yes! Lunch-time to-day it
was, and your papa was smoking his cigar and
looking out to sea all by himself. It was very
quiet, with all the donkey-engines stopped and the
men eating inside the walls. On the bluff beyond
the fort I was sitting, with my feet hanging over
the edge, and the mango-tree I've told you so often
about was shading me from the sun. The wind
was blowing just a wee mite, and every time the
wind would blow and the tree would wave, a mango
would drop into the bay. Plump! it would go
into the ocean below, and every time a mango
dropped down a Little Man in a green coat popped
up."</p>

<p>"All wet, papa?"
<span class='pagenum'>[13]</span></p>

<p>"Shiny wet, Sonnie-Boy, and blowing their
cheeks out like so many blub-blubs."</p>

<p>"What's blub-blubs, papa?"</p>

<p>"A blub-blub is a fat little fish who takes big
long gulps deep down in the ocean and then comes
to the top o' the water, and, when he sees anybody
watching him, puffs out his cheeks and goes&mdash;blub-blub!
like that."</p>

<p>"Like men sometimes, papa?"</p>

<p>"Just like. Well, by 'n' by there were twelve
o' the Little Men in green coats, and they sat under
the mango-tree all in a row and looked at me, and
the one at the head o' the row puts up one finger,
with his head to one side and his little round eye
rolling out at me, and he says: 'Did Sonnie-Boy's
godfather send him that steam-engine from Japan
yet, what you told us about? 'Cause if he did, we
have a fine pome about it.'</p>

<p>"'Yes, he did send him a fine steam-engine from
Japan,' I said, 'and you go on and let me hear your
pome, and if it's a good pome I'll give you all a fine
ripe mango to eat.' And so they all puffs out their
fat little cheeks and they begins:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"'Godfather bought him an engine, red and black,<br /></span>
<span>It wabbles slightly and the wheels don't track&mdash;&mdash;'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But it don't, papa, 'n' the wheels do track."</p>

<p>"But that's what they said.
<span class='pagenum'>[14]</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"'But Sonnie-Boy felt prouder than England's queen<br /></span>
<span>When it puffed real smoke and sure-enough steam.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But it's a king in England, papa."</p>

<p>"I know, but that's the way the Little Green
Men told me. Some things they don't know yet,
they're so little.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"He named it Lightning 'cause of its speed,<br /></span>
<span>And the 'casional spills he did not heed.<br /></span>
<span>All big roads had accidents, people knew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>There was danger sure when the whistle blew.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It's true, 'bout th' accidents, isn't it, papa?"</p>

<p>"Nothing truer. Now, let me see. What else?
Oh, yes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"'The Lightning Express is coming back,<br /></span>
<span>Clear the way there, people, off the track!<br /></span>
<span>Or Sonnie-Boy's engine, red and black,<br /></span>
<span>Will knock you down and hit you whack!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

"That's great, papa. And did they have a band
with them?"

<p>"No. No band, but one little six-toed fellow&mdash;I
'most forgot him&mdash;was playing on a hook-a-zoo.
That's a sausage-shaped thing, with things
like rabbit's ears on it. The music comes out
the ears."</p>

<p>"And what kind of music, papa?"
<span class='pagenum'>[15]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, like a jew's-harp something, only being
bigger 'twas louder. Zoo-zoo, zoo-zoo-zoo it
went."</p>

<p>"I like those Little Green Men, papa, but where
was the Little Blue Men to-day, did they say?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they'd gone to a wedding, the hook-a-zoo
player said."</p>

<p>"They know everything, don't they, papa?"</p>

<p>"M-m-most everything."</p>

<p>"And will the Little Men tell me things when
I'm a big man, papa?"</p>

<p>"If they don't, I won't let 'em have any more
mangoes."</p>

<p>"An' what the bugle men play 'n' what the
flags say when they hoists them up in the air on
the big gun-ships, papa?"</p>

<p>"If you're a good boy, they will. And now
what d'y' say if we go in and you tell Diana your
papa wants some hot water out of the kettle. And
while you're doing that and auntie and godfather
are talking things over to themselves, I'll be laying
out my razor and my soap 'n' things all ready to
shave. There you are, there's the boy!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was after dinner on Welkie's veranda. The
two friends had been smoking for some time in
silence. Young Greg had just left with his aunt
to go to bed. Balfe was thinking what a pity it
<span class='pagenum'>[16]</span>
was the boy's mother had not lived to see him now.
He turned in his chair. "What would you do
without him, Greg?"</p>

<p>Welkie understood what his friend had in mind.
"It would be like the days having no sunrise. I'd
be groping in the dark, and almost no reason for
me to keep on groping. Splashed in concrete and
slaked in lime, from head to toe, steaming under
that eternal sun, five hundred spiggities and not
half enough foremen to keep 'em jumping, I find
myself saying to myself, 'What in God's name is
the use?' and then I'll see a picture of his shining
face running to meet me on the beach, and, Andie,
it's like the trade-wind setting in afresh. The
men look around to see what I'm whistling about.
But"&mdash;Welkie sniffed and stood up&mdash;"get it?"</p>

<p>Balfe caught a faint breath, the faintest tang
borne upon the wings of the gentlest of breezes.</p>

<p>Welkie went inside. Presently he returned with
bottles and glasses. "When a little breeze stirs,
as it sometimes does of a hot night here, and there's
beer in the ice-box and the ice not all melted, life's
'most worth living. Try some, Andie&mdash;from
God's country. And one of these Porto Ric'
cigars. Everybody'll be smoking 'em soon, and
then we poor chaps'll have to be paying New
York prices for 'em, which means we'll have to
make a new discovery somewhere."
<span class='pagenum'>[</span></p>

<p>"Wait, Greg&mdash;I almost forgot." Balfe stepped
to his suit-case, took out a box of cigars, and
handed it to Welkie. "From Key West. Hernando
Cabada. When I told him I was going to
see you, he sat down and rolled out that boxful,
which took him three hours, and gave them to me
for you. 'For my friend, Mis-ter Wel-keey-ay,'
he said."</p>

<p>"Good old Hernando!" Welkie opened the
box. Balfe took one, Welkie took one; they
lit up.</p>

<p>"Ah-h&mdash;" Welkie woofed a great gob of smoke
toward the veranda roof. "Andie, you won't
have to make any chemical analysis of the ashes
of these cigars to prove they're good. There is an
artist&mdash;Hernando&mdash;and more! I used to drop in
to see him after a hot day. He would let me roll
out a cigar for myself in one of his precious moulds,
and we'd sit and talk of a heap of things. 'Some
day, Hernando,' I'd say, 'along will come some
people and offer you such a price for your name
that I reckon you won't be able to resist.' 'No,
no, my friend,' he would say. 'For my nam' there
shall be only my cigar. I shall mak' the good,
fine cigar&mdash;until I shall die. And for the sam'&mdash;one
pr-r-ice.' How'd you come to run into him,
Andie?"</p>

<p>"I'd heard about him and you. I suspected,
<span class='pagenum'>[18]</span>
too, that he could verify a few things about the
Construction Company."</p>

<p>"And did he?"</p>

<p>"He did. And so they have been after you
again?"</p>

<p>Welkie nodded.</p>

<p>"And offering more money than ever?"</p>

<p>Welkie nodded.</p>

<p>They smoked on. Again Balfe half turned in
his chair. "I haven't seen you, Greg, since the
President sent for you from Washington that time.
How did you find him?"</p>

<p>"Fine. And I tell you, Andie, it heartened me
to think that a man with all he's got to tend to
would stop to spend an hour with an obscure engineer."</p>

<p>"You're not too obscure, Greg. What did he
have to say?"</p>

<p>"Oh-h&mdash;said he wanted me to do a piece of
special work, and he wanted me because several
people, in whose judgment he had confidence,
said I was the man for the job. You were one
of 'em, Andie, he told me, and I'm thanking you
for it."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that you ought to thank me,
Greg. With that big company you would be
wealthy in a few years, but the trouble is, Greg,
when I'm on the job I'm as bad as you, only in a
<span class='pagenum'>[19]</span>
different and more selfish way. I know only one
road then, and once I set out I'd brush aside anything
for the one thing, Greg."</p>

<p>"Of course, when it's for the flag."</p>

<p>"Would you?"</p>

<p>"Could I do anything else?"</p>

<p>"The boy, too?"</p>

<p>"Where would he come into it, Andie?"</p>

<p>"You don't think that your feeling for the lad
and your work could ever clash?"</p>

<p>"How could they ever clash, Andie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Greg. I hope not." He relit
his neglected cigar. "But what else did the
President have to say?"</p>

<p>"He said it was a bit of emergency work he
wanted me for, that only the remnant of a small
appropriation was available for it, and that if I
took it I would be pitiably paid; but that he wished
me to do it, because some day, and that not too
far away, it might have to stand the test not of
friends, but of enemies. Also he said&mdash;let me
see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That for foreign policy's sake it would have
to be done quietly, without advertising, as a bit
of departmental work?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"And that you would get no great reputation
out of it, that your very report would remain
<span class='pagenum'>[20]</span>
a supplementary paper buried in departmental
files?"</p>

<p>"That was it."</p>

<p>"Did it strike you that the conditions were
hard, Greg?"</p>

<p>"Not after he explained things. And so when
the Construction people said to me later: 'You're
crazy, man! Look the two propositions in the
eye!' I said: 'I've looked one of 'em at least in
the eye and I'm passing the other up&mdash;and the
other is yours.'"</p>

<p>"Lord, Greg! whether you're the best or the
worst concrete man in the world is a small matter&mdash;you're
a great man. And if some day&mdash;" Balfe
let his front chair-legs come down bang and
bounded to his feet.</p>

<p>"Greg"&mdash;it was Marie who had returned&mdash;"I
don't know how I ever forgot, but I never thought
till a moment ago&mdash;there was a Mr. Necker here
to see you this evening."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't often forget, Marie. Must be
the sight of those battle-ships. Necker? I don't
know any Necker. You know him, Andie?"</p>

<p>"I was trying to guess coming over on the boat.
I was still guessing when he got off. I could
guess, Greg, who he is, but it would be only a
guess."</p>

<p>"He didn't leave any message, Marie?"
<span class='pagenum'>[21]</span></p>

<p>"None, except to say that he would call again
at eight. He seemed to know something of you
and to be friendly."</p>

<p>"He must be a friendly soul to come to this
place to see anybody. Well, when he comes we'll
know. How'd you leave Sonnie-Boy?"</p>

<p>"He's waiting for you to say good night."</p>

<p>"I'll go up to him." He went inside.</p>

<p>Marie picked up her ensign. Balfe placed a
chair for her at the little work-table, and himself
took the chair on the other side of the table.</p>

<p>"A great joy for you, also&mdash;young Greg, Marie?"</p>

<p>"If you could hold him and feel his little heart
against yours when he's saying 'Good night,
auntie,' after he's said his prayers! His prayers
and the 'Star-Spangled Banner' are his great set
pieces."</p>

<p>"And between you and Greg it's safe to say
he's got both letter-perfect."</p>

<p>"And spirit-perfect, we're hoping. But I must
get on with this ensign for him."</p>

<p>"Pretty good size, isn't it, for a toy ship?"</p>

<p>"But it's a battle-flag. He'll have none but
battle-flags. There, I'm up to the stars."</p>

<p>"You're never far from them. Let me make a
stretching-frame of my fingers and square this
end."</p>

<p>"Do. Not quite so tight. And now&mdash;those
new States come in so fast!&mdash;how many now?"
<span class='pagenum'>[22]</span></p>

<p>"Forty-six."</p>

<p>"M-m&mdash;four eights and two sevens?"</p>

<p>"Four eights and two sevens."</p>

<p>She sewed rapidly, and without looking up,
until she had completed the first row. "There&mdash;there's
one of the eights. Now you can breathe
again, Andie."</p>

<p>Balfe sat back. "What did you make of Mr.
Necker, Marie?"</p>

<p>She, too, sat back. "I wonder what I did make
of him. He was very curious about you."</p>

<p>"That's interesting."</p>

<p>"Yes. He asked questions and I couldn't
quite fib to him, and yet I couldn't see why he
should expect me to tell him all about you. And
so"&mdash;she paused and the little half-smile was
hovering around again.</p>

<p>"And so?"</p>

<p>"And so I did not attempt to check his imagination."
She repeated the conversation of the
afternoon. "I meant to speak of it at dinner,
Andie, to you and Greg, but I forgot."</p>

<p>"Here's a far traveller&mdash;" He paused. She
looked up, and quickly looked down.</p>

<p>"&mdash;who gives thanks that you forgot, Marie,
in that first glad hour, Mr. Necker and his&mdash;well,
his possible mission."</p>

<p>"You know something of him, then, Andie?"</p>

<p>"I'm still guessing. But I'm wondering now
<span class='pagenum'>[23]</span>
if you said to yourself when he had gone: 'After
all, what will Greg get out of this government
work? Is it fair to himself to refuse those great
offers and stick down here? And what will it
mean to young Greg?'"</p>

<p>Marie Welkie let the ensign drop onto the
table. "My very thoughts in words, Andie.
And while we're speaking of it, will Greg ever get
the recognition due him, Andie?"</p>

<p>"Surely&mdash;some day."</p>

<p>"Dear me, that some day! After he is dead, I
suppose. You men are the idealists! But being
only a woman, Andie Balfe, I don't want to wait
that long to see my brother rewarded."</p>

<p>"And being only a man, Marie Welkie, I also
want to see my friend rewarded before he's laid
away."</p>

<p>"But will he ever?"</p>

<p>"Who could answer that? But I stopped off
in Washington on my way, Marie, and had a
long talk with a man who is fine enough to appreciate
the dreams of idealists and yet sufficiently
human to allow for most human weaknesses. We
discussed Greg and his work. The Construction
people were mentioned. He asked me if I thought
Greg would go with them. 'And if he does, Mr.
President, can be he blamed?' was my answer."</p>

<p>"And how did he take it?"
<span class='pagenum'>[24]</span></p>

<p>"He leaned back in his chair and looked through
his glasses with his eyebrows drawn together, in
that way you'd think he was scowling if you didn't
know him. After a moment he said: 'I should be
sorry, but if he does, no professional or legal&mdash;no,
nor moral&mdash;obligations can hold him.'"</p>

<p>"There! Greg does not even get credit for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait. 'But will he?' he continued. I said
that I did not think so. 'What makes you think
he won't?' 'Because I know him, sir. But,' I
went on, 'don't you think, Mr. President, that by
this time he should have a word of encouragement
or appreciation?' And that led to quite a
talk."</p>

<p>"About Greg, Andie?"</p>

"Greg and his work, Marie."

<p>She leaned her elbows on the table and from
between her palms smiled across at him. "When
you use that tone, Andie, I know that all women
should stay silent. But could&mdash;couldn't a little
sister to the man in the case be given just a little
hint?"</p>

<p>"To the little sister&mdash;Oh, much! To her I can
say that I have reason to think that something is
on its way to her brother which will be very pleasing
to her and to him."</p>

<p>"For which, my lord, thy servant thanks thee."</p>

<p>Eight bells echoed from the fleet. "Eight
<span class='pagenum'>[25]</span>
o'clock, and somebody walking the beach! It
couldn't be, Andie&mdash;it couldn't be that Mr.
Necker&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Balfe gravely shook his head.</p>

<p>"But, Andie," she whispered, "there was the
most friendly expression in his eye!"</p>

<p>"If there's a living man, Marie"&mdash;he bent over
also to whisper&mdash;"who could hold speech with you
for ten seconds without a friendly gleam&mdash;" A
knock on the veranda door interrupted.</p>

<p>It was Necker. "How do you do again, Miss
Welkie?" To her his bow was appreciative,
deferential. To Balfe he nodded in a not unfriendly
fashion.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you again, Mr. Necker. Come
in, please. I will call my brother." She pressed
a button on the veranda wall. "That will bring
him right down, Mr. Necker. And now I'm leaving
you with Mr. Balfe. Diana, our cook's little
boy has a fever&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fever, Marie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry, Andie, if you're thinking of
danger. It's only malaria. And it's only a step
or two, and you must stay with Mr. Necker."</p>

<p>Balfe held the door open for her. She paused
in the doorway. "I'll be back in half an hour."</p>

<p>"Half an hour! Time is no bounding youth,
Marie Welkie."
<span class='pagenum'>[26]</span></p>

<p>"Come for me, then&mdash;Oh, when you please,"
she whispered, and passed swiftly out.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Necker was examining the shelf of books above
the work-table. "Keats? Keats? Oh-h, poetry!
Montaigne. Montaigne? Oh, yes!" He took
it down. "H-m, in French!" and put it back.
One after the other he read the titles. "Elizabethan
Verse. E-u-r-i-p-i-d-e-s. Dante. H-m."</p>

<p>Balfe by now had turned from the screen door.
Necker pointed to the shelf. "Not a book for a
practical man in the whole lot, and"&mdash;he held up
the ensign&mdash;"this! Isn't that the dreamer through
and through?"</p>

<p>"But you and I, not being dreamers, consider
how thankful we should be."</p>

<p>Necker stared in surprise, and then he smiled.
"Now, now, I'm meaning no harm to your friend.
I guess you don't know what I'm after, though
I'll bet I can guess what you're after."</p>

<p>Balfe, fairly meeting Necker's eye, had to
smile; and when Necker saw Balfe smile he winked.
"You don't s'pose you could come down here to
this God-forsaken hole, do you, without somebody
getting curious?"</p>

<p>"I suppose it was too much to expect. Have a
smoke?"</p>

<p>"Thanks." Necker's tone was polite, but it
<span class='pagenum'>[27]</span>
was a most negligent glance that he gave the box
of cigars. There was no name on the box. Balfe,
with unsmiling mien, pointed out two small letters
on the cover. "H. C., Mr. Necker."</p>

<p>"H. C.?"</p>

<p>"Hernando Cabada, Key West."</p>

<p>"O-ho! How'd you ever manage to get hold
of a box of them?"</p>

<p>"They're Welkie's."</p>

<p>"How can he afford 'em? I offered old Cabada
a dollar, a dollar and a half, and finally two dollars
apiece for a thousand of 'em, coming through
Key West the other day&mdash;and couldn't get 'em.
Nor could all the pull I had in the place get 'em
for me. He wasn't going to make any more that
week, he said. He's a queer one. He's got all
those Socialist chaps going the other way. For
why should he work four, five, six hours a day, he
said, when he could make all he wanted in one
or two? Sells cigars to people he likes for fifteen
dollars a hundred, but wouldn't sell to me at any
price. I had to take my hat off to him&mdash;he stuck.
Now, how do you dope a chap like that?"</p>

<p>"How do you?"</p>

<p>"Don't know the real values in life. Maybe
a bit soft up top, besides." He lit up and drew
several deep inhalations. "M-m&mdash;this is a smoke
for a man!" He picked up the box gently. "If
<span class='pagenum'>[28]</span>
I thought Welkie'd take it, I'd offer more than a
good price for the rest of that box. But"&mdash;suspicion
was growing in his eyes&mdash;"how does it
happen&mdash;d'y' s'pose somebody's been here ahead
of me after all?"</p>

<p>"He's coming down-stairs now&mdash;ask him,"
smiled Balfe.</p>

<p>Welkie stepped into the veranda. "I was in
my workroom when the buzzer told me you had
come in, Mr. Necker, but on the way down I
couldn't help looking in on young Greg. I'm
glad to see you."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Welkie. And to
get right down to business, I'm the new president
of the Gulf Construction Company, and I want
to talk a few things over with you."</p>

<p>"Surely."</p>

<p>"Greg"&mdash;Balfe had opened the door&mdash;"how
far up the beach to your cook's shack?"</p>

<p>"Oh, for Marie? A hundred yards that side."</p>

<p>"I'll look in there. Good night, Mr. Necker."</p>

<p>"Don't hurry away on my account, Mr. Balfe.
I'd like you, or any friend of Mr. Welkie and his
family, to hear what I have to say. It's a straight
open-and-shut proposition I've got."</p>

<p>"Then we'll try to be back to hear some of it.
Good-by for a while, then." The door closed behind
him.
<span class='pagenum'>[29]</span></p>

<p>"Let's sit down, Mr. Necker."</p>

<p>"Thanks. And how did you leave that boy of
yours?"</p>

<p>"In his little bed, with his pillow jammed up
close to his window-screen, singing the 'Star-Spangled
Banner' to himself and looking out on
the lights of the fleet. He's afraid they'll steam
away before he's seen his fill of them, and to-night
he's not going to sleep till he hears taps, he
says."</p>

<p>"It must be a great thing to have a boy like
him, and to plan for his future and to look forward
to what he'll be when he's grown up."</p>

<p>Welkie looked his interrogation.</p>

<p>"Surely, Welkie. A boy of brains he'll be. I
don't have to look at a man or a boy twice.
Brains and will power. You could make a great
career for him, Welkie&mdash;a great engineer, say, if
he was started right. But, of course, you'll be
in a position by and by to see that he gets the
start."</p>

<p>"Started right? What does he want when he
has health and brains and a heart?"</p>

<p>"All fine, but he'll need more than that these
days."</p>

<p>"Are these days so different?"</p>

<p>"Different, man! Why, the older a country
is, the more civilized it is, the more education
<span class='pagenum'>[30]</span>
means, the more social position counts, the more
money counts."</p>

<p>"How much more?"</p>

<p>"A heap more. Listen. Your father on twenty-five
hundred a year, say, could put his children
through college, couldn't he? On twenty-five
hundred a year to-day a man with a family has
to battle to keep out of the tenement districts.
A dozen years from now, if you're getting no more
money than you're getting now, you'll be wondering
if you won't have to take that boy out of
school and put him to work. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>Welkie made no answer.</p>

<p>"All right. But before I go any farther, let
me say that I want you, Mr. Welkie, for our new
job."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with the man you've got?"</p>

<p>"He won't do. You're the one man we want, and if there's money enough in
our strong box, we're going to get you. And now that I've got that off,
let me show you where it is for your higher&mdash;I say your higher, not
alone your moneyed&mdash;interests to come with us, Mr. Welkie. There's
that boy of yours&mdash;you'd surely like to see him a great man?"</p>

<p>"I surely wouldn't dislike it."</p>

<p>"Good. Then give him a chance. Get rid
first of the notion that a poor boy has as good a
<span class='pagenum'>[31]</span>
chance as another. He hasn't. I know that all
our old school-books told us different&mdash;along with
some other queer things. No wonder. Nine
times out of ten they were got up by men born
poor and intended for children born poor. It is
a fine old myth in this country that only the poor
boy ever gets anywhere. As a matter of fact, the
poor boys outnumber the comfortably born boys
ten to one, yet run behind in actual success. Even
history'll tell you that. Alexander&mdash;son of a
king. C&aelig;sar? Frederick the Great? Oh, loads
of 'em! You don't seem to think much of that?"</p>

<p>"Not a great deal," smiled Welkie. "If you're
going to call the long roll of history, it looks to
me like it's a mistake to name only three, or twenty-three,
or thirty-three men. You cast your eye
along that little book-shelf there and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been looking them over&mdash;Dante and
Michael Angelo and Homer and Shakespeare and
that knight-errant Spaniard and the rest of 'em.
But I'm not talking of poets and philosophers and
the like. I'm talking of the men who bossed the
job when they were alive."</p>

<p>"But how about those who bossed it after they
were dead?"</p>

<p>"But, damn it, Welkie, I'm talking of men of
action."</p>

<p>"Men of action or&mdash;ditch-diggers?"
<span class='pagenum'>[32]</span></p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"That's what I call most of 'em, Necker&mdash;ditch-diggers.
If your man of action hasn't himself
thought out what he's doing, that's what he
looks like to me&mdash;a ditch-digger, or at best a
foreman of ditch-diggers. And a ditch-digger, a
good ditch-digger, ought to be respected&mdash;until
he thinks he's the whole works. Those kings of
yours may have bossed the world, Necker, but,
so long's we're arguing it, who bossed them?"</p>

<p>"You mean that the man who bosses the world
for thirty or forty years isn't quite a man?"</p>

<p>"Surely he's quite a man; but the man who
bosses men's minds a thousand years after he's
dead&mdash;he's the real one. And that kind of a man,
so far's I know things, Necker, never lived too
comfortably on earth. He can't. I tell you,
Necker, you can't be born into a fat life without
being born into a fat soul, too."</p>

<p>"You're not stinting yourself in the expectation
of running things after you're dead, Welkie?"</p>

<p>Welkie noted the half-ironical smile, but he
answered simply, evenly: "It's not in me; but
I'd live even a sparer life than I do, if I thought
anybody after me had a chance."</p>

<p>"You're a hard man to argue with, Welkie,
and I'm not going to argue with you&mdash;not on
<span class='pagenum'>[33]</span>
things dead and gone. You're too well posted
for me. But suppose it was that way once, is it
that way to-day? I'll bring it right home to you.
Here's the overpowering figure in public life,
Roosevelt, a man you think a lot of probably&mdash;was
he born in poverty?"</p>

<p>"No, but I notice he cut away from his comfortable
quarters about as soon as his upbringing'd
let him."</p>

<p>"Wait. In finance who? Morgan? All right.
Son of a millionaire financier, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"But if you're going to bring in money&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. What of the Carnegies and the
Rockefellers? you're going to say. There's where
you think you've got me, but you haven't; for
I've always said that being born in poverty fits
a man to make money above all things, because
he's brought up to value it out of all proportion
to everything else. But where are they
after they get it? America's full of millionaires
who came up out of nothing, but who had to work
so hard getting started that they'd nothing left in
'em or didn't know anything but money when
they got to where they could stop to look around.
If they had any genius to start with, it was dried
out of 'em trying to get going. Hitch any two-mile
trotter to an ice-wagon and where will he
finish? You overweight your boy going off and
<span class='pagenum'>[34]</span>
he will be handicapped out of the race, too. But
can I have another one of those cigars?"</p>

<p>"Help yourself."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I wish I had your pull with old
Cabada. Now, Welkie, I'm only trying to show
you where you ought to cast aside certain outworn
traditions and face actual present-day
truths. Now listen. You probably don't believe
I'm a villain, Welkie, and you know I represent
a powerful corporation&mdash;reputable even if
powerful. Yes. Well, this work of ours is good,
useful work&mdash;don't you think we can fairly claim
that?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful work&mdash;beautiful."</p>

<p>"Good. Then wouldn't you like to see that
work growing under your hand&mdash;ten thousand
men driving night and day, and that concrete
structure reaching out, as you've planned it, in
long white stretches to the sea?"</p>

<p>"It's certainly a fine prospect."</p>

<p>"Then why not do it? What's the use, Welkie?
You're the best man in the country for us and
we're the best concern for you. We offer you the
biggest job in sight. What d'y' say? You've
been turning us down, but think it over now."</p>

<p>Welkie shook his head.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;but they are coming back."
<span class='pagenum'>[35]</span></p>

<p>Necker could see the hands of Balfe and Miss
Welkie unclasping in the half-darkness as they
entered. He touched Welkie on the arm. "Why
not tell Miss Welkie and Mr. Balfe what it is I'm
after?"</p>

<p>"But I'm doing work here that I've got to
finish, and they know that."</p>

<p>"I know you are, but consider this. What does
the government pay you here, Welkie? I probably
know, but no matter."</p>

<p>"Two hundred a month and this house."</p>

<p>"And I'm offering you two thousand! And&mdash;listen
to this, please, Miss Welkie. In place of a
mosquito-infested shoe-box of a shack in a God-forsaken
hole, we'll give you and your brother a
fine concrete house on a breezy hill in God's own
country&mdash;a real home, Miss Welkie, with great
halls and wide verandas and sun-lighted rooms
through which the sea breezes will blow at night so
you can sleep in peace. A mansion, Miss Welkie,
with reception and music rooms, where you can
receive your friends in the style a lady should, or
a man of your brother's ability should. A place
to be proud of, Miss Welkie&mdash;palm-studded, clean-clipped
lawn rolling down to the sea. And a sea&mdash;I'll
bet you know it, Mr. Balfe&mdash;a blue-and-green
sea rolling down over to coral reefs as white
as dogs' teeth, a shore-front that needs only
<span class='pagenum'>[36]</span>
building up to be as pretty as anything in your
swell Mediterranean places. What d'y' say,
Welkie? And here's the contract now, all ready
for you, and pay begins to-day."</p>

<p>"It's alluring, it surely is. But I must finish
here."</p>

<p>"But you'll soon be done here. A few weeks
more, they told me in Washington. What are
you going to do then?"</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought."</p>

<p>"Well, why not think of it now? Consider
your boy, what it will mean to him some day.
Why not ask Miss Welkie?"</p>

<p>Welkie turned gravely to his sister. "What
do you say to that fine house with the grand dining-room,
and the music-room, and a jasmine-twined
pergola to sit out under of a night&mdash;and
watch the moon roll up from the shining sea? I
know the house&mdash;it's all that Mr. Necker says it is."</p>

<p>"And mahogany, and all kinds of beautiful
linen for the table, Miss Welkie. Imagine that,
with cut glass and silver and the electric candles
gleaming over it of a night."</p>

<p>"I would dearly love to preside at the head of
that table, Mr. Necker, but Mr. Balfe was speaking
of something that perhaps my brother should
hear about first."</p>

<p>"What's that, Andie?"
<span class='pagenum'>[37]</span></p>

<p>"Let it wait, Greg."</p>

<p>"Better now. What is it?"</p>

<p>"You may not like it."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, but we may as well have it now,
Andie."</p>

<p>"I was to tell you that after this work is done
there's another job waiting you on the west coast,
just as important, just as needful of your supervision,
and no more reward to it than this."</p>

<p>"Whee-eu!" whistled Necker. "The steamer
captain had him right."</p>

<p>"Then I'm afraid"&mdash;Welkie turned to Necker&mdash;"it's
off between us."</p>

<p>"Don't say that yet. Wait till you hear. What
are you working for? Leaving the money end
out of it, which I know you don't care for and
never will care for, what are you getting? You
want recognition? And prestige? Do you get
them? Not a bit. Who really knows of this
work? A few engineers who keep tabs on everything,
yes. Who else? Nobody. The government,
for good reasons of their own, don't want
it mentioned in the press. Why, it's hardly mentioned
in the engineering journals."</p>

<p>"Even so. It will go down in the records that
I did it."</p>

<p>"Will it? Look here. I've been waiting for
that." From his inside coat-pocket Necker drew
<span class='pagenum'>[38]</span>
out several typewritten sheets. "Mind you, I
didn't want to produce this, but I'm forced to.
My first interests are my company's. There is a
copy of the last official report on this work. Read
what that says. The credit is given, you see, to
who? To you? No, no. Not a mention of you
except as a civilian engineer who assisted."</p>

<p>"But how did you get hold of this?" Welkie
held the papers, but without showing any inclination
to read them.</p>

<p>"Does how I got hold of it matter?"</p>

<p>"That's right, it doesn't matter."</p>

<p>Welkie offered the papers to Balfe.</p>

<p>Balfe waved them back. "I saw the original
of that report in Washington. What Mr. Necker
says is so."</p>

<p>"There!" Necker brought his fist down on
the table. "The man of all others to bear me
out." He stepped close to Balfe. "I couldn't
place you for a while. Thanks for that."</p>

<p>"Don't hurry your credit slip," snapped Balfe,
with his eyes on Welkie.</p>

<p>Welkie silently passed the papers back to
Necker.</p>

<p>"You believe me now, Mr. Welkie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know's I doubted you, Mr. Necker.
It caught me just a mite below the belt, and I had
to spar for wind."
<span class='pagenum'>[39]</span></p>

<p>"But it wasn't I who hit you below the belt, remember.
Neither did I want to destroy your illusions,
but I did want to show you the facts&mdash;the
truth, not the glittering romance, of life. Now
they're offering you another job. Will you, or
somebody else, get the credit for that? You?
No, sir! You'll get neither money nor reputation
out of it. With us you'd get both."</p>

<p>"Probably that's so." Welkie spoke slowly.
"But people in general will credit me with loyalty
at least."</p>

<p>"Will they? Even where they know of your
work, will they? When a man turns down an
offer like ours, people in general will give him
credit for little besides simple innocence. I'm
telling you they'll be more likely to think you are
controlled by some queer primitive instinct which
will not allow you to properly value things. I'll
leave it to your friend. What do you say to that,
Mr. Balfe?"</p>

<p>"I think you're a good deal right."</p>

<p>"There! Your own friend agrees with me!"
exclaimed Necker.</p>

<p>"You don't think that, Andie?" Welkie, puzzled,
stared at Balfe.</p>

<p>"What I mean, Greg, and what Mr. Necker
very well understands me to mean, is that surely
there are hordes of people who never will believe
<span class='pagenum'>[40]</span>
that any man did anything without a selfish motive."</p>

<p>"That don't seem right, Andie."</p>

<p>"No, it doesn't, but it's so, Greg. But"&mdash;he
set his jaw at Necker&mdash;"what if they do think so?
Let them. Let them ride hogback through the
mud if they will. Oceans of other people, oceans,
will still be looking up to men like Greg Welkie
here." He rested his hand on his friend's shoulder.
"You stick to your aeroplaning in the high
air, Greg."</p>

<p>"And chance a fall?" suggested Necker.</p>

<p>"And chance a fall!" snapped Balfe. "But
there are no falls if the machine is built right and
the aviator forgets the applause."</p>

<p>Marie Welkie's hand reached out and pressed
one of Balfe's. He held it. "It's all right&mdash;he's
a rock," he whispered.</p>

<p>"I must say, Welkie"&mdash;Necker fixed his eyes
on the floor and spoke slowly&mdash;"that the government
in this case seems to be represented by a
man of picturesque speech, a man with imagination.
I can only handle facts, and in a matter-of-fact
way. I ask you to consider this: you
have a boy, and there is Miss Welkie, a lovely,
cultured woman, and"&mdash;he jerked his head suddenly
up&mdash;"but what's the use? Here's a contract,
needing only your signature, and here's a
<span class='pagenum'>[41]</span>
check, needing only my signature. I said two
thousand a month. Suppose we make it three?
Here's pen and ink, and remember your boy is
looking out on the battle-ships from his little bed
up-stairs."</p>

<p>"You're right, Necker, he is in his little bed
up-stairs and I've got to think of him." He
turned to Balfe. "The President, Andie, just
naturally expects me to tackle this new job?"</p>

<p>"I think he does, Greg."</p>

<p>"Then there's only one answer left, Mr. Necker.
No."</p>

<p>"Wait again. Welkie, you've a God-given
genius for concrete work. I came here to get you
and I&mdash;sign now and I'll make it four thousand."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"No? Why, look here! Here's a check. See&mdash;I'm
signing it in blank. I'm leaving it to you
to fill it in for what you please. For what you
please for your first year for us, and the contract
to run five years at the same rate. Remember
you've been trimmed once and you're likely to be
trimmed again."</p>

<p>"Let them trim me and keep on trimming me!
The work is here and I did it. They know it
and I know it. If nobody but myself and my
God know, we know. And no official or unofficial
crookedness can wipe it out."
<span class='pagenum'>[42]</span></p>

<p>"But that little fellow up-stairs with his face
against the screen?"</p>

<p>"It's that little fellow I'm thinking of. He'll
never have to explain why his father reneged on a
job he was trusted to do."</p>

<p>"But you haven't promised anybody in writing?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And, as I make it out, you haven't even given
your word?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then what right has anybody to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He don't need to have any <i>right</i>. He just
thinks I'm the kind of a man he can count on,
and, in a show down, that's the kind of a man I
reckon I want him or any other man to think I
am."</p>

<p>"Then it is finally no?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No. And let that be the end of the noes."</p>

<p>Necker smoked thoughtfully. Then, slowly
gathering up his papers, he said: "I'm licked,
Welkie; but I would like to know what licked me.
It might save me from making the same mistake
again."</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know's I know what you mean;
but there is one thing, Necker: if it ever happens
<span class='pagenum'>[43]</span>
that a nation which don't like us comes steaming
up here to get hold of this base, to batter it to
pieces, say, she won't. No. And why? Because
it's no haphazard mixture of water and sand. It's
a good job, and if I'm no more than a lump of
clay in my grave, I want to be able to roll over
and say"&mdash;a flame seemed to shoot from his eyes&mdash;"'You
sons o' guns, you can't get in, because
what you've come to take was built right, and
'twas me built it, by God!'"</p>

<p>Necker studied him. "Well, if that isn't throwing
a halo around your work, I don't know what is.
I've met that before, too. But you've got more
than that&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"If I have, I don't know it." He paused.</p>

<p>"I know," whispered Marie in Balfe's ear&mdash;her
eyes turned to the ensign on the table.</p>

<p>"But if there's anything else there, it must've
been born in me, and so that's no credit. But if
there is anything else there, I want my boy to
have it, too."</p>

<p>Necker picked up his hat and cane. "He'll
have it, never fear, Welkie, and the more surely
because he won't know it either. I'm off. Do
you mind if I take another of Cabada's cigars?"</p>

<p>"Surely. Help yourself. Fill your case."</p>

<p>"Thanks." He lit up. "These <i>are</i> a smoke.
I wish he'd let me have some, but he's like you
<span class='pagenum'>[44]</span>
something&mdash;he's only to be got at from the inside,
and I guess I'm not on the inside. Good-by,
Welkie. I hope you get your reward some day,
though I doubt it. Good-by, Mr. Balfe. You're
the first of your kind I ever met. You fooled me,
but I'll be ready for you next time. Good-by,
Miss Welkie. I forgot to say"&mdash;he smiled slyly&mdash;"there
was a sixty-horse-power French car and
a fifty-foot motor-launch went with that house.
Good-by."</p>

<p>The pebbly beach crunched under Necker's receding
feet. "Dear me," sighed Marie, "don't
you feel half sorry for him, Andie?"</p>

<p>"Just about half. I'll bet he plays a good game
of poker. But, Greg&mdash;" Balfe drew a square
white envelope from an inner coat-pocket&mdash;"I was
given a letter the other day to give you&mdash;in case
you were still on the job here."</p>

<p>"On the job? Where else could I be?" He
had taken the envelope and was about to rip it
carelessly open, when his eye caught the embossed
blue lettering on the corner:</p>

<p>WHITE HOUSE</p>

<p>He held it up in bewilderment. "Not from the
President, Andie?"</p>

<p>"Why not? Read it."</p>

<p>Slowly Welkie read it. He took it over to the
<span class='pagenum'>[45]</span>
light at the little table and read it again. He
dropped it on the table and gazed through the
screen at the lights of the fleet. After a time he
said in a low tone: "I must tell Sonnie-Boy," and,
turning, went inside the house.</p>

<p>"Is it very private, Andie?" whispered Marie.</p>

<p>"No, no."</p>

<p>"Then I'm going to read it."</p>

<p>She read it. "Why, Andie!" she gasped, and,
crowding to the light, she also read it again. Her
face was alight when she looked up at last. "Andie,
Andie, isn't it splendid! If Mr. Necker could
only hear this:</p>

<p>"'It is a fine thing in these days of materialism
that a man of your genius can set aside the allurements
of money and fame, and exile yourself
to a region where certain hardship and probable
disease await you; and this only that your country
may be served.' And the rest of it! O Greg!"</p>

<p>Welkie was back with his boy in his arms.
He took the letter from his sister. "Look here,
Sonnie-Boy, what do you think? Here's a man
says your papa is the greatest man ever was in
his line. Years from now you'll look at that letter
and perhaps you'll be proud of your papa. Your
papa's boasting now, Sonnie-Boy, but only you
and your auntie and godfather can hear him,
and they'll never tell. So that's all right. 'Our
<span class='pagenum'>[46]</span>
papa was as good as anybody in his line'&mdash;a great
man said so. What do you say, little five-and-a-half,
you'll be a good man, too, in your line
some day, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Can I be a fighter, papa, on a big gun-ship?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you're bound to go that way, I don't
see who's to stop you, Sonnie-Boy. But if you
are, whether it's a sword to your belt or a lanyard
to your neck, here's hoping you'll never go over
the side of your ship without"&mdash;he picked the
ensign up&mdash;"you leave your colors flying over her.
And now we'll go back to bed, Sonnie-Boy, and
this time we'll go to sleep." In the doorway he
stopped. "What do you reckon Necker would
say to that letter, Andie?"</p>

<p>Balfe smiled. "He'd probably say, 'Welkie,
you ought to publish that letter&mdash;capitalize it,'
and think you were four kinds of a fool if you
didn't."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't publish it or capitalize it. I'm
going to frame it and hang it at the foot of your
bed, Sonnie-Boy, where you'll see it mornings
when you wake. Up we go, son."</p>

<p>Facing each other across the little work-table
were Marie Welkie and Andie Balfe. She had
said: "You surely have been my brother's friend,
and, if you were not already so successful, I could
wish a great reward for you."
<span class='pagenum'>[47]</span></p>

<p>He laid one hand of his gently down on hers.
"Wish the reward, then, Marie. Do, dear, wish
it, for I'm not successful. I played hard at my
game, because playing it made me forget other
things. Almost anybody playing a game long
enough becomes half-expert at it. But successful?
No, no, dear. So far I seem to have travelled only
unending roads through bleak countries; and I'm
dreading to go back to them alone."</p>

<p>Beyond the veranda screen the fireflies were
flashing; farther out, the little green and red side-lights
of the steaming launches, like other colored
fireflies, were sliding by; to the mastheads of the
battle-ships the red and white signal-lights were
winking and glowing. The night was alive with
colorful things. Closing her eyes, Marie could hear
the lapping of little waves over pebbles, the challenging
hail of a sailor on watch, the music of a
far ship's band. She bent her head to hear it
better&mdash;the sweetly faint cadence of that far-away
band.</p>

<p>"And when was it you began to think of me,
Andie?"</p>

<p>"Since those first days, Marie, when your
brother and I bunked together in the old S. A. M.
construction camp. He used to read me letters
of yours from home. You were only a little girl
then, and it was years before I saw you; but I
<span class='pagenum'>[48]</span>
knew what you looked like even before I stole your
photograph&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stole?"</p>

<p>"I did. Greg dropped it one day. I found it
and never gave it back. There it is&mdash;after nine
years."</p>

<p>She laughed when she saw it. "Why, I can't
make out to see what I looked like then, Andie!"</p>

<p>"I know what you looked like. I've kissed
the face away, dear, but I know. In nine years,
Marie, I never shifted from one coat to another
without shifting your photograph, too. If anything
had happened to me, they would have found
your photograph on me, with your address on
the back. 'Then,' I used to say to myself, 'she'll
know. And Greg won't mind my stealing it.'"
He laid it face up between them on the table.
"The miles you've travelled with me, dear heart,
and never knew! Back in the days of the construction
camp they used to find sketches of a
girl's head in my note-books, a beautiful head
badly done&mdash;drawn from that photograph. But
after I met you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And after you met me, Andie?"</p>

<p>"Then I needed no photograph, though look
and look at it I surely did. Steamers in western
seas, battle-ships in eastern waters, balustrades
of palaces&mdash;wherever it might be I was whirling
<span class='pagenum'>[49]</span>
with this old earth around, I've had your face to
look at. And when I couldn't see for the darkness&mdash;rolled
up in my rubber poncho, in no more romantic
a place than the muck of a swamp, I've
looked up through the swaying branches&mdash;or in the
lee of a windy hill, it might be, with no more to
hinder than the clear air, I've looked up and
marked your face in the swirling clouds: your nose,
your chin, the lips so shyly smiling. And if
through the clouds a pair of stars would break,
I'd mark them for your shining eyes, Marie."</p>

<p>"Poetry again, Andie!" She was laughing, but
also she was melting under his eyes.</p>

<p>"If that's poetry, then I'm losing respect for it.
It's a weak thing, Marie, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh-h&mdash;if somebody should be walking on the
beach!"</p>

<p>"Let them, sweetheart. It's a fine night for a
walk. What harm is truth?"</p>

<p>"But I don't want all the world to hear, Andie.
For my poor heart was aching, too, Andie, and
now it wants it all to itself, Andie mine."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was taps on the battle-fleet. Over the mellowing,
detaining waters of the bay the long-drawn
bugles echoed. Good night, good ni-i-ght,
g-o-o-d-n-i-g-h-t&mdash;they said, and gently, softly,
whisperingly died away.
<span class='pagenum'>[50]</span></p>

<p>"He's asleep at last." Welkie was standing in
the door. "And I don't know but we'd all better
be getting to sleep, too. For to-morrow morning,
you know, we&mdash;Wha-at!"</p>

<p>His friend was standing before him. "Shunt
care for the morrow, Greg. Greater things than
have happened are happening around you. The
dream of years has come to pass. And we&mdash;we,
Greg&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked to her, and tremulous, vivid, she came,
and with her at his side he was himself again.
"Marie is to take me for Sonnie-Boy's uncle, and,
Greg, we want your blessing."</p>

<h2><a name="tim" id="tim"></a>TIM RILEY'S TOUCH</h2>



<p>"A man outside&mdash;says his name's Riley,"
announced the youth who guarded the
outer door. "A big husky!" he added when he
saw the chairman did not look pleased.</p>

<p>The state chairman nodded round the table.
"This is that new man the senator's been talking
about." From a neat pile of letters the chairman
picked out one.</p>

<p>"Here is what he sent in the other day. From
it you can obtain an idea of the calibre of the man.
Listen: 'As you ask me what I think about the
crowd up here, I'll say that I think they've had
their own way so long they've got to where they
figure they don't have to make good. They seem
to think that to be in politics is to be trying to
fool everybody. They would rather&mdash;the most of
them&mdash;get ten votes by faking than a hundred by
straightforward work. They don't seem to see
that nowadays people know more about the inside
of things than they used to&mdash;that they're
doing more thinking for themselves in political
matters.'
<span class='pagenum'>[54]</span></p>

<p>"And"&mdash;the chairman reinserted the letter in
the neat pile&mdash;"there's more drool of the same kind.
I don't believe he ever wrote that letter. As I
understand it, he's a coal-heaving sort who ought
to have gone into the prize-ring and not politics;
but, whether he wrote it or not, we will have to
humor him because of the senator, who is of course
the boss"&mdash;he shot a glance round the table&mdash;"the
boss now. We'll give this fellow a little rope.
A couple of the boys up where he comes from
tipped me off about him&mdash;and we'll let the senator
see him for what he is. I've seen these wonders
before."</p>

<p>"And I guess you don't have to see too much
of a man to be able to size him up either!" This
from a faithful one on the chairman's right.</p>

<p>The chairman's lips kneaded shut. "Well, in
political life&mdash;I don't say this in a boasting
spirit, you understand, gentlemen&mdash;if a man in
my position can't size a man up fairly well at
a glance he might as well get out. His letter
alone would tell me that he knows it all, and the
word I get from the county chairman up his way
is that he is one of the turbulent, fighting kind.
However, we'll have him in here and look him over.
Show him in, George."</p>

<p>And Riley stepped into the room. From the
moment of his entrance not a soul there had a
<span class='pagenum'>[55]</span>
doubt of the chairman's prejudgment; but, that
his less acute associates might judge for themselves,
the chairman allowed the man by his own
words to portray himself, which, after all, was the
most convincing proof of all. It was the senior
senator's own way of doing it.</p>

<p>The new man&mdash;an agile, powerful figure&mdash;had
bowed with a conventional show of pleasure to
each in turn as he was introduced; but, that over
with, he had faced squarely toward the chairman,
waiting. And the chairman began:</p>

<p>"I take it, Mr. Riley, that you are not the kind
of man who would stand up on a platform and
dodge an argument with the most excitable of
opponents?"</p>

<p>"Dodge? What from?"</p>

<p>"Not from the hoots and the jeers, or vegetables&mdash;or
even the half-bricks&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Riley waved a contemptuous arm. "I'd rather
see half bricks coming my way than be looking
down on staring empty benches, or benches emptying
swiftly when a man's at the height of his
speech." Riley paused by way of emphasis.
"It is to try a man's soul&mdash;a frosty greeting;
but, a warm-blooded opposition&mdash;that's only to
stir a man up."</p>

<p>The state chairman waited for the new man to
leap into the air, knock his heels together and yell:
<span class='pagenum'>[56]</span></p>

<p>"Hurroo!" The new man did not do that. He
gazed steadily into the face of the chairman.
However, every specimen could not be expected
to meet every requirement. No doubt of it&mdash;here
was the made-to-order creature for clever
manipulation; and there followed then the suggestion
to visit New Ireland, with artful words to
whet a fighting man's appetite for that kind of
job.</p>

<p>"And now for one last little touch before we
send the poor boob to his political extinction,"
whispered the chairman to his next at hand.
Aloud he said:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;I believe in frankness, Mr. Riley.
And I will tell you now that we didn't poll many
votes in New Ireland last year. I don't just remember
how many&mdash;I have mislaid the figures;
but I wish to tell you frankly&mdash;frankly, I say&mdash;that
we did not poll many. What they need
there, I think, is a determined man like yourself
to pile into them hammer and tongs. That
would be the way, I think. And you show me,
Mr. Riley, a fair Republican increase in New Ireland&mdash;fifty
out of five hundred, say&mdash;and you can
lay out your own itinerary for the rest of the
campaign. Now isn't that fair?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes; that seems all right." As he said
it, however, the new man, his eyes ever on the
<span class='pagenum'>[57]</span>
chairman's, had a feeling that it was not all right.
And, as he was one of those intuitive ones with
whom to feel was almost to prove, his attitude
changed from the subjective to the objective. He
had not liked this man a bit from the first, and he
was liking him less and less; that finishing "Now
isn't that fair?" was surely not meant for his
benefit.</p>

<p>The new man left the committee-rooms with a
disturbed soul, and on his way to the elevator he
began to think things over. Among a dozen other
things which flashed through his kindling brain he
recalled the glint of what now he knew was
mockery brightening the pale eyes of the chairman
as the door closed behind him.</p>

<p>He pressed the button for the elevator; but
before the upcoming car reached his floor he decided
not to descend. He would have it out.
He almost ran back to the committee-rooms and,
brushing by the knowing but inefficient outer
guard, made for the room where the leaders were.
Already he could hear the laughter&mdash;yes, and the
roaring at something or other; and as he placed
his hand on the knob of the inner door he heard:
"He's come here from the other end of the State,
with a reputation for burning things up. Let
him try to burn up New Ireland&mdash;and then go
back to where he came from. Why, let his kind
<span class='pagenum'>[58]</span>
come butting in on us and soon we would all be
out of jobs." The chairman's voice, that was.</p>

<p>Tim opened the door, and when they looked up
and saw him it was as if they had all been clutched
by the windpipes.</p>

<p>"Go to the devil&mdash;all of you!" exploded the
new man. "Do you hear? Every mother's son
of you!"</p>

<p>From out the silence some one at last said:
"You mean, Mr. Riley, you are going to desert
the party?"</p>

<p>Tim whirled on him.</p>

<p>"No; it doesn't mean I'm going to desert the
party. Did ever you know a man who was any
good to desert any party or anything, good or
bad, under fire?"</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear that." The chairman had
come to life. "And not alone because we would
lose you, eloquent though you are reported to be.
So many of our people have maintained that no
Irishman&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Cut that Irishman stuff! My chance to make
a living, and my children's chance after me, I owe
to this country."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Riley, you are of Irish blood."</p>

<p>"Irish blood? You may be sure I am, and so
proud of it that when I speak of it I slop over;
but I'm an American citizen too. However, if
<span class='pagenum'>[59]</span>
you don't mind, we'll leave that for private discussion
and not for political trading."</p>

<p>The chairman recovered.</p>

<p>"That's all very well; but when we ask your
people to make sacrifices for the principles of our
party&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Principles of the party&mdash;slush! Save that
for your platform speeches. You're in the party
because there's more in it for you. I'm in it
because a man who gave me a square meal when
I was starving asked me to join it. And, once in
a fight, I stick. I stick because I don't know how
to do anything else&mdash;and I'm going to stick now.
And I'm going out now to New Ireland and talk
to them."</p>

<p>The door behind Tim opened and a smooth,
carefully trained voice said: "What's this about
New Ireland?"</p>

<p>Tim knew the voice, even before he turned to
greet him. It was the tall boss, the real boss, the
senior senator, the man who ordered the State
committee round even as they ordered the campaign
speakers.</p>

<p>"New Ireland?" the senator repeated. "No,
Mr. Riley. I can give you something better than
that. That would be a waste of time. I'll change
that right now. Here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir; but I'm going to New Ireland.
<span class='pagenum'>[60]</span>
I don't know what kind of a place it is or
what kind they are there, except what the name
tells me, and I don't care&mdash;I'm going there. No
gang of men ever picked me for an omadhaun in
the morning but found out they were mistaken
before night. And I'll say further"&mdash;indignation
in Tim always disposed him to classic periods&mdash;"if
there are those who wave the green flag to
tatters at every Irish meeting, and then betray
her to those who hate her, there are also those
who, though they have never made a sacrifice in
their lives for this country, would prevent all but
their own little kind from breathing the free air
of it. As for me, I've come to this city to do
something; and I'll stay here until I've done it.
A while ago I agreed to go to New Ireland, and
to New Ireland I'm going. Good day!" And
the windows rattled with the banging of the door
behind him.</p>

<p>"A proper bull-headed Irishman, that fellow,"
observed the chairman presently.</p>

<p>"Or is it he has convictions and is not afraid
to voice them?" The senator had a habit of
scratching his beard with his finger-nails, and again
of drawing his chin in on his chest and looking over
his gold-rimmed pince-nez. He drew in his chin
now, and the chairman did not like it. He never did.</p>

<p>"A good fighter, I should say." The tall boss
<span class='pagenum'>[61]</span>
scratched his beard with his finger-nails. "An
encouraging thing to meet a good fighter in these
fat days; but let us see." He stepped over to
where a blue-and-red-spotted map of the State
was hanging and laid a finger on a blue spot:
"New Ireland, which we can safely call the enemy's
banner town for its size in the United
States. If Riley can leave his mark on that place
it will be proof to me that he can make breaches
all along the line."</p>

<p>"More likely, I think, that the place will leave
its mark on him. More likely they will crack his
skull, I think. He may love a fight; but New Ireland
is full of men who love fighting too&mdash;and they
are not with us."</p>

<p>"That's true&mdash;they are not." The boss drew
his chin in to his neck again. "Too bad they are
not. Suppose we wait, however, and see how
Riley makes out. His reputation is that of a
most resourceful man. And if he does make an
impression on New Ireland he can have anything
I can give him in this State."</p>




<h3>II</h3>


<p>It is a good place&mdash;a moving train&mdash;for serious
meditation. Tim Riley allowed the landscape to
fly by, the while he considered matters. He knew
<span class='pagenum'>[62]</span>
the temper of the kind of people with whom he
was to battle. They were so many more like himself.
As for trying to bulldoze or browbeat them,
or&mdash;if he was that kind&mdash;to bribe a single one,
though they were the hard-working, unsophisticated
kind&mdash;whisht!&mdash;like the wind they'd go the
other way. And as for scaring the tough ones,
he might be the strongest and toughest and scrappiest
and quickest lad on his feet that ever was,
but out there in that quarrying town would be a
dozen or twenty or fifty just as strong and as
quick and as scrappy as himself. And that kind&mdash;which
was his kind&mdash;you might set them up in a
row and knock them down one after another, and
just as fast as one went down another would come
bouncing up for the honor of the last word.</p>

<p>New Ireland! Tim viewed a town of two or
three hundred small, square-planned wooden
houses, with one green-painted house larger than
most, labelled Kearney's Hotel; another, larger
than that again, with a square cupola, which he
knew would be the town hall; and yet one more,
largest of all, white-painted, with a surmounting
gold cross, which, of course, could only be the
chapel. A mile or so beyond the town, on the
scarred hillsides, stuck up the derricks of the
quarries, which were the town's reason for being.
Beyond the quarries were foot-hills, which gradually
<span class='pagenum'>[63]</span>
grew up into mountains. It was autumn, and
in that high land the few trees were already bare;
before the high wind the bare branches swayed.</p>

<p>It was not the most encouraging day of the
year. Tim, with a warm fire and a hot meal in
view, hurried on to the little hotel. Peter Kearney
was the landlord, a companionable soul, who
did not see the need of a register, and who, after a
time, produced a lunch; and who, further, while
Tim ate, smoked and gossiped of things a travelling
man would naturally be interested in.</p>

<p>"And what kind have you here in New Ireland?
Easy to get along with?" asked Tim, after
the discovery of the quarries, the settling of the
town, and the last explosion had been intelligently
discussed.</p>

<p>"To get along with? The finest, easiest ever&mdash;of
course if a man don't cross them."</p>

<p>"I wonder do you think I'll cross them?"</p>

<p>"And what would your business be that you'd
be crossing 'em?" the landlord asked.</p>

<p>"I'm the Republican campaign speaker that's
selected to address them to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh-h! Well, d'y'know, when I didn't see a
sample case with you I had my suspicions; but
when you said&mdash;or did you say your name was
Riley?"</p>

<p>"I did. And it is. R-i-l-e-y&mdash;Riley, Timothy
<span class='pagenum'>[64]</span>
J. And there's any number of Republicans with
names as good."</p>

<p>"I dare say, but not in New Ireland&mdash;nor likely
to be while so many of your party put us down for
a tribe of savages."</p>

<p>"Have patience, Mr. Kearney. There's a new
order of things under way. Have patience. And
tell me now how many Republicans should you
estimate there are in New Ireland?"</p>

<p>"Estimate? Sure, and that's a large word for
them. There's Grimmer, the cashier and chief
clerk o' the savin's-bank. There's Handy, who
keeps the real-estate office. And did ever ye
notice, Mr. Riley, how, when a man has a soft-payin',
easy-workin' job, 'tis ten to one he's a
Republican?"</p>

<p>"I've spoken of it so often myself, Mr. Kearney,
merely by way of humorous observation, that my
party loyalty has been doubted. If you would
never have your loyalty suspected, Mr. Kearney,
you must never let on that you possess intelligence;
but have patience and we'll have that
changed some day&mdash;maybe. So those two are the
leaders, are they?"</p>

<p>"Leaders, man! That's all of 'em."</p>

<p>"Two? Two out of nigh five hundred! Well,
glory be, what kind are those two? The fighting
kind?"
<span class='pagenum'>[65]</span></p>

<p>"Har-rdly the fightin' kind, Mr. Riley. They
couldn't well be that in New Ireland, bein' Republican,
and remain whole. Har-rdly! No, not
if they were John L. Sullivans, the pair of 'em.
Among five hundred quarrymen, d'y'see, Mr.
Riley, and they mostly young men, there's always
plenty of what a man might call loose
energy lyin' round&mdash;specially after hours and Sundays
and holidays; surely too much for any two,
or two dozen, disputatious individuals to contend
against. And yet, as I said, the easiest, quietest
people living here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; I'll bet a leprechaun's leap against
a banshee's wail I know what peaceable kind they
are. And I think I know now why I was&mdash;No
matter about that though. Could you, Mr.
Kearney, get somebody to pass the word to the
quarries that the Republican speaker is here according
to announcement, and that his name is
Riley?"</p>

<p>"I'll send me boy. Dinnie!" called the landlord.
No answer. "Dinnie!" No answer. The
landlord opened his lungs and roared: "Dinnie!!"
Then he looked out of the dining-room window.
"H-m! I thought as much. Look at him peltin'
it on his bi-sigh-cle for the quarries! He heard
you say Republican and 'twas enough. No fear
now&mdash;not a soul in New Ireland but will know it
<span class='pagenum'>[66]</span>
before dark. And&mdash;but excuse me one minute,
Mr. Riley."</p>

<p>The landlord stood up to greet a forlorn-looking
old woman, who, with a man's overcoat
wrapped round her, had appeared at the dining-room
door.</p>

<p>"How are you to-day, Mrs. Nolan? About as
usual? Well, don't be worryin'. Yes, you'll find
Delia in the kitchen. Go in."</p>

<p>Tim nodded after the old woman as she went in.</p>

<p>"And who is she, Mr. Kearney?"</p>

<p>"A poor old creature who comes here once or
twice in the week to have a cup o' tea and maybe
a little to go with it, with the cook. A poor old
soul dependin' on charity, and yet she won't take
it from every one."</p>

<p>"Poor woman! Will you give her that?&mdash;not
now, but when she goes out, Mr. Kearney." He
slipped a silver dollar into the landlord's hand.
"No need to tell her where it came from. I'll
be going along now, I think, to have a look at the
town. I'll be back for supper."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you!"</p>

<p>Tim had not left the hotel a hundred yards
behind him when he met a Catholic priest.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Father," said Tim, and
raised his hat.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, sir. And is it"&mdash;the cane
<span class='pagenum'>[67]</span>
was shifted from the right hand to the left, and
the hand thus freed extended to Tim&mdash;"Mr.
Riley&mdash;isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It is; but how did you know, Father?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if Peter Kearney's long-legged Dinnie
hasn't told half the quarries before this of your
name and business 'twill be because he's burst a
tire or broke his neck rolling down the steep hills.
And so you're to speak to us to-night?"</p>

<p>"God willing, I am."</p>

<p>"And you're not discouraged?"</p>

<p>"And why should I be discouraged?"</p>

<p>"Why? You must be a stranger to these
parts."</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"And no one told you of what happened to the
last man your party sent here?"</p>

<p>"They did not. And what happened?"</p>

<p>"He was rode out of town on a rail."</p>

<p>"Well, well, Father. And what did he do, the
poor man?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he only hinted at first that we were a lot
of ignorant foreigners who were Democrats because
we didn't know any better; but he warmed
up as he went along. I don't know wherever they
got him from. In the middle of it Buck Malone
gave them what they call his high sign&mdash;his
right forefinger raised so&mdash;and every man in the
<span class='pagenum'>[68]</span>
hall got up and walked out. A few of them came
back later and took him off. They didn't hurt
him&mdash;no bones broken or anything like that; but
they do say he never waited for the train when
they turned him loose, but legged the thirty miles
back to the city without a single stop!"</p>

<p>"He did? Well, it's fine exercise, Father&mdash;running;
though thirty miles in one bite, to be sure,
is a bit too much for good digestion, I'd say.
This Buck Malone&mdash;he's the boss here, Father?"</p>

<p>"He is. And a famous one for surprising folks."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the information, Father."</p>

<p>"It's no information. The very babies here
know of the last man here. If you see the children
in the street smiling slylike when you pass, that
will be why."</p>

<p>Tim pulled his lower lip with thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>"And yet they'd laugh all the louder if I was to
go away without speaking, Father. What kind is
Buck Malone to look at and where does he hang
out?"</p>

<p>The priest poked the end of his cane at Tim's
chest.</p>

<p>"Is it fighting you'd be at, Mr. Riley?"</p>

<p>"It is not. I'm not for fighting&mdash;unless, of
course, I have to. Isn't it only natural to want to
know what kind your opponent is?"
<span class='pagenum'>[69]</span></p>

<p>"So it is&mdash;so it is. Well, then, about this time
o' day you'll find him in that cigar-store with the
sign out&mdash;below there. He's a contractor himself,
who furnishes labor for the quarries. A man
about your height and breadth he'll be, but a
trifle fuller in the waist. A stout, strong man, and
not many able to look him down. An eye in his
head, has Buck! I wouldn't want to see the pair
of ye at it."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Father. And look&mdash;d'y'see that
old woman coming out of the hotel? What's her
story, Father?"</p>

<p>"The widow Nolan. A sad history, Mr. Riley,
if you could get it out of her; but it's few she'll
talk to."</p>

<p>"Poor woman! Would you give her this&mdash;a
couple of dollars&mdash;Father, after I'm gone?"</p>

<p>"I will. And it's good of you. And you're
bound to speak to-night?"</p>

<p>"I'll speak. And I'd like you to come, Father."</p>

<p>"Not I, Mr. Riley. Priests are better out of
politics. Good day and God speed you!"</p>

<p>Tim strolled toward the cigar-store; and drawing
near he picked out, standing near the glass
case, a tall, powerfully built man, with intelligently
heavy features and the unwavering eyes of
a fighting man. As Tim entered this man was
speaking. Before ten words had been said, Tim
<span class='pagenum'>[70]</span>
knew that his entrance had been forecasted and
that this was Buck Malone.</p>

<p>"And he'll be up there on that platform all
alone&mdash;not a soul with him, because these two
dubs that ought to be standing by him, they've
got cold feet already. And he'll be up there all
alone, except for a pitcher of cold water and a
glass, and a table and a chair; and he'll begin to
spout. I dunno whether he c'n talk or not; but
we'll let him run on for maybe ten minutes, and
about the time he thinks he's making a hit I'll
start up and I'll raise my forefinger like that&mdash;see?
And that'll mean everybody get up and go
out. No hurry, mind you&mdash;nor no hustlin'; but
everybody just stand up and walk out and leave
him talkin' to that picture o' that dago, or whoever
he is, discoverin' the Mississippi on the back
wall.</p>

<p>"And now you"&mdash;Malone turned leisurely to a
stocky-looking young fellow in seedy clothes standing
wistfully off to one side&mdash;"you go on and pass
the word to 'em as they come out o' the quarries."</p>

<p>"All right," answered the stocky one in a hoarse
voice, but without moving.</p>

<p>A meagre-looking man stood behind the cigar-case.</p>

<p>"Will you let me have," said Tim to him,
"three good cigars?"
<span class='pagenum'>[71]</span></p>

<p>The man behind the cigar-case looked slyly at
Malone.</p>

<p>"How good?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty fair&mdash;three for a dollar or so."</p>

<p>"Three for a&mdash;I got nothing like that here.
Fifteen cents straight's the best I got."</p>

<p>"All right; they'll do."</p>

<p>The boss had not been smoking when Tim
entered; but now he turned to look better at
Tim, and he pulled a cigar from his vest-pocket,
bit off the end, scratched a match, and leisurely
lit it&mdash;all without taking his eyes off Tim.</p>

<p>Tim also leisurely bit the end off a cigar. The
proprietor pushed three or four matches across
the case. Tim, ignoring them, stepped close to
the boss.</p>

<p>"Would you let me have a light?" he inquired
politely.</p>

<p>"H-ff! h-ff!" The boss swallowed quite a
little smoke, but recovered and passed over his
cigar. Tim took his light from it, said "Thanks!"
briefly, and&mdash;puff-puff&mdash;contemplated the boss's
stout henchman in the rusty clothes, who was
still standing irresolutely at one side.</p>

<p>"Smoke?" inquired Tim suddenly, and thrust
a cigar at him.</p>

<p>"Wh-h&mdash;" stuttered the henchman, and then
almost snatched it from Tim's hand.
<span class='pagenum'>[72]</span></p>

<p>"You gettin' hard o' hearin'? Thought I told
you to get along!" snapped Malone.</p>

<p>"I am goin' along," returned the husky voice,
"soon's I light up." In the curling of the smoke
from the corner of his mouth, in the whoofing of
it toward the ceiling, in the squaring of the thick
shoulders as he passed out&mdash;there was a hint of
rebellion.</p>

<p>"You may be the boss," thought Tim, "but
your grip isn't too sure." And turning squarely
on Malone he observed genially: "Fine day."</p>

<p>"H-p-p&mdash;" Malone stared fixedly at Tim.
Tim stared back. Tim was rapidly developing a
feeling of respect for the man. Tim knew the
kind. A few years back he had been such an
uncompromising one himself, who would have
whipped off his coat, as no doubt Malone would
now, and battled on the spot in preference to
verbal argument.</p>

<p>"It is a fine day," responded Malone slowly;
"but accordin' to my dope it ain't goin' to be half
so fine a night."</p>

<p>From behind the cigar-case came a giggle, and
from the boss himself came an after-chuckle and
a pleased little smile.</p>

<p>"Why, it's not going to rain, is it?" asked Tim,
and with an appropriately innocent manner he
stepped to the door to look at the sky; and in
<span class='pagenum'>[73]</span>
looking he saw not the sky, but the widow Nolan,
with some odds and ends of firewood, making her
halting way against the wind.</p>

<p>"The poor creature!" murmured Tim; and
while pitying her the plan came to him. "Gentlemen,"
he said over his shoulder, "I have to be
off; but before going I cordially invite you and all
your friends to the town hall to-night, to discuss
the issues of the campaign. Good day, gentlemen."</p>

<p>And through the door, before it closed after
him, he could hear the cackle of the man behind
the cigar-case: "Is it going to rain! Say, Buck,
you won't do a thing to him to-night, will yuh?"</p>




<h3>III</h3>


<p>With his greeting of "Good afternoon to you,
Mrs. Nolan!" Tim stowed the widow's little bundle
under his left arm.</p>

<p>"And good afternoon to you, sir; but you'll be
sp'iling your fine clothes, sir!"</p>

<p>"And if I do it's small loss." He gripped her
right elbow. "It's the hard walking it is, Mrs.
Nolan&mdash;what with the wind and the steep hill
and an old lady of your age."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeh, it is&mdash;coming on to seventy-five."</p>

<p>"Seventy-five? And you still hopping about
active as a grasshopper! A great age that. 'Tis
<span class='pagenum'>[74]</span>
little, I'm afraid, many of us young ones will be
thinking of climbing steep hillsides when we're
coming on to seventy-five. 'Tis you was the
active one in your young days, I'll wager."</p>

<p>"'Tis me that was, sir; but oh, I'm not that
now."</p>

<p>"It's sad it must be to be looking back on the
bright dancin' days o' youth, Mrs. Nolan."</p>

<p>"Sure and it is, sir; but why&mdash;the fine bouncin'
lad ye are&mdash;why should you be sayin' it?"</p>

<p>"Ah, sure, youth has its trials and tribulations
too, ma'am, sometimes. And is this your little
place?"</p>

<p>"It is. An' will you come in, sir?"</p>

<p>"I will and thank ye kindly, ma'am. 'Tisn't
every day a lady invites me into her place."</p>

<p>"Whisht! There are ladies enough to be pleasant
to a fine strappin' lad like you, with nothing
on earth to be botherin' you."</p>

<p>Tim laughed as he sat down.</p>

<p>"Nothing? Oh, ma'am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what is it can be worryin' you, sir?"</p>

<p>"What is it? Well, if you had my job, Mrs.
Nolan, I'm thinkin' you'd be worrying, too; even
if 'twas big and strong and a man you were, and
but thirty years of age. I'm the Republican
speaker, ma'am, that has been sent to ye here.
And for why? To convert ye, ma'am."
<span class='pagenum'>[75]</span></p>

<p>"And so you're a Republican, sir? Well, well&mdash;but,
savin' your presence, you don't look it or
talk it. Sure, you're as Irish as myself!"</p>

<p>"I'm that Irish, ma'am, that if you were to
take the Irish from out of me it's faded and limp
as a mornin'-glory at two in the afternoon I'd
be."</p>

<p>"And what's your name, may I ask?"</p>

<p>"Riley, ma'am. Timothy Joseph Riley, to be
exact."</p>

<p>"Riley&mdash;Tim Riley! Well, you're the first
Riley ever I knew was a Republican. That thin-necked
one in the bank, and that other one, the
fat-necked one in the real-estate place&mdash;sure, you
don't favor them no more than&mdash;Yet there must
be good men Republicans, too. Will you have a
cuppeen o' tea? 'Tisn't much; but 'twill war-rm
you, maybe, on the chill day."</p>

<p>"Thank you; and 'twill taste fine&mdash;a cup o'
tea on a chill day like this. And like to be chiller,
Mrs. Nolan."</p>

<p>"True for ye. And gen'rally I feels it; but not
so to-day, sir. Mr. Kearney gave me a dollar,
sayin' it was from a stranger and I wasn't to mention
it&mdash;and I won't; but"&mdash;she shot a quick,
warm glance at Tim&mdash;"God guard the kind heart
of him, whoever he is. To-morrow I'll be orderin'
some beautiful groceries with it. Tis a gran'
<span class='pagenum'>[76]</span>
sinsation to be goin' into a store and orderin'
things."</p>

<p>She stooped for her little bundle of fagots, but
Tim forestalled her. He undid them, arranged
them craftily in the stove with rolls of old newspaper
beneath, and touched a match to the fire.</p>

<p>"There, ma'am."</p>

<p>"We'll have the little kittle b'ilin' in a minute
now, sir."</p>

<p>"And what will you do against the cold winter
comin', ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeh! I'll do, no doubt, what I've done
every winter since I come here&mdash;live through it."</p>

<p>"With the cold wind coming through the wide
cracks and the snow piling high on the wintry
mornings, it won't be the tightest place in the
world, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Thanks be to God I have it&mdash;the same little
cabin!"</p>

<p>"Thank God you have! Whisht, ma'am"&mdash;- Tim
laid a restraining hand on hers as she spooned
the tea out of the can&mdash;"you won't be leaving
yourself any at all."</p>

<p>"Sure, there's enough for the breakfast. And
if we could always be sure of our breakfast it's
little we'd have to complain of. And now let me
get out my cups and saucers. I have two of each,
thank God!"
<span class='pagenum'>[77]</span></p>

<p>"Let me, Mrs. Nolan&mdash;I see them."</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;but 'tis the spry lad ye are!
Sure, you're across the floor in one leap&mdash;like a
stag just."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure; my legs are young. And one spoonful
o' sugar is it, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"One&mdash;yes. And now sit down. And so it's
a Republican ye are? And an Irishman, too?
Well, well&mdash;they do be queer happenin's in the
world!"</p>

<p>"Queer enough. And from what part of Ireland
are ye, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Galway."</p>

<p>"A fine place, ma'am. I know it."</p>

<p>"Do ye now? But you're not Galway?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't lie to ye, ma'am, though I'm
tempted&mdash;I'm not; but I had an uncle, as fine a
man as ever lived, who died there. I went to see
him there once, and a grand time I had with salmon-fishin'
in the loch and fishin' with the Claddagh
men in the bay&mdash;and on a Saturday night
the little boys singin' the old Irish songs in the
streets and before Mrs. Mack's hotel door. And
was it in Galway the last of your people died?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't. And they didn't die&mdash;they were
killed, God rest their souls!"</p>

<p>"Amen!"</p>

<p>The sticks in the little stove crackled; the
<span class='pagenum'>[78]</span>
water in the little kettle spluttered; a gaunt
black cat crowded his way through the poorly
fastened door and rubbed himself against Tim's
legs, whereat the widow threw a stick of wood at
him.</p>

<p>"Out o' that, you with your mud on you from
the quarry pools sp'ilin' the gentleman's fine
clothes!"</p>

<p>"Small harm he'll do, ma'am."</p>

<p>"It's better manners he ought to be havin',
though 'tis fine to see a man like yourself hasn't
too much conceit of his clothes. But now have
your tea, avic."</p>

<p>"I will. Ah-h! and the fine tea, it is, too. And
isn't it a queer thing now, Mrs. Nolan, that I can
go to the finest hotels in the land and not get the
like o' this for tea? The finest of hotels&mdash;yes;
and here in a little cabin, with the wind blowing
through the cracks, I'm havin' tea that for its
equal I'd have to go&mdash;well, to China itself, I'm
thinking. But tell me, Mrs. Nolan&mdash;it's as a
friend I ask&mdash;what misfortune was it brought
you to be living in a little shebeen on this rocky
hillside?"</p>

<p>The old woman made no response, except to
add three or four little sticks of wood from her
pile to freshen the fire. It was still chilly and outside
it was windy, and Tim drew the man's worn
<span class='pagenum'>[79]</span>
coat about her shoulders and made her sit closer
to the fire. And by and by she told him.</p>

<p>When she had done the twilight was on them
and the fire long gone out. Through the one
little window of the cabin they could see the increasing
lights in the town below, and from the
road they could hear the tramping of heavy-booted
men.</p>

<p>"They'll be hurrying home from the quarries
now. And 'tis not a lonesome home they will be
finding."</p>

<p>"True, ma'am."</p>

<p>And Tim sat there smoking the last of the
three cigars he had bought that afternoon, and
thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;sometimes of the evening's
work before him, but mostly of the old woman's
story.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeh; if it was but a stone I had to put on
their two graves in the cemetery below!" she said
after a long silence.</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't you have the stone to put
over them?" Tim jumped up and patted her
white, straggling hair. "And you will have it,
Nanna. Come with me to-night and I'll guarantee
you'll have it."</p>

<p>"And where will I go?"</p>

<p>"With me and have a fine, hot supper at Kearney's&mdash;and
then to the town hall to hear me
speak."
<span class='pagenum'>[80]</span></p>

<p>"Indeed and I'd like that fine, Mr. Riley; but
they don't be invitin' women&mdash;old women&mdash;to
any rallies."</p>

<p>"Tis me is giving the rally, and I'll invite
whom I please&mdash;I mean, if you're not afraid of
the rioting when they don't like, maybe, what
I'm going to say to them."</p>

<p>"Me afraid? Of what? Sure and they could
be liftin' the roof itself from the town hall and a
lone woman like myself would be safe among
them. But why should you be wanting me
there?"</p>

<p>"Why? I'll tell you, Nanna, and you must
take it for the true reason until I can give you a
better. And who knows it isn't the true reason?
I'm that vain, Nanna, that I want some one soul
there that isn't against me&mdash;some one that, before
ever I begin, I know will hear me out. If you're
there I know whose heart will be warm to me
while I'm speaking. For 'tis terrible discouraging
to see nothing but cold faces staring up from the
benches and your heart bursting to tell them what's
in it."</p>

<p>"Sure and it must be, avic. The cold heart&mdash;'tis
an awful thing. A bony black cat itself is
more company in the house than one of ourselves
when the heart is ice. But whisper"&mdash;she
leaned doubtfully toward him&mdash;"d'y' think
there'd be hope of you turnin' Dimicrat?"
<span class='pagenum'>[81]</span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm fixed where I am. I'm not
easily turned, Nanna."</p>

<p>"Oh, yeh! Well, well&mdash;in one minute, Timmie
avic, I'll be along with you."</p>

<p>And she dusted the hearth and gathered up her
cups and saucers, which, as she washed, Tim
dried. And presently he was guiding her halting
steps down the hill.</p>




<h3>IV</h3>


<p>At eight o'clock that night Tim was facing his
audience, and a fine, large audience it was&mdash;not
a hand's width in a single bench vacant; from
the front row, where sat Buck Malone, almost
smiling, to the back wall, where De Soto with
some Indians and mailed companions was discovering
the Mississippi&mdash;from stage to entrance,
not a vacant seat. What hopes for a man in a
fighting audience like that if he could but win
them to him!</p>

<p>Tim was alone on the stage.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he began, "the Republican party
in New Ireland seems to be very busy to-night.
One-half of it has to attend a conference of bank
cashiers over in Rocktown; and Rocktown, it
appears, is four miles in a buggy over a rough
road. That rough road and the buggy are, of
<span class='pagenum'>[82]</span>
course, an incontrovertible argument, gentlemen.
And the other half has a rich prospective
customer for a couple of town lots&mdash;also over
in Rocktown. A busy little place that Rocktown
must be! I don't wonder you're smiling. I
smiled myself when they told me.</p>

<p>"But if they are not here, gentlemen, to accredit
me, I am here to speak for myself. And,
as you see, there is the table, the chair, the ice-water
pitcher, the empty glass, all as"&mdash;he smiled
down at the boss in the front row&mdash;"as Mr. Malone
said it would be. 'Twas this very afternoon Mr.
Malone spoke of it; and, myself happening to
hear him, I would not for a lord lieutenant's income
disappoint him. 'Twas my good old mother&mdash;God
rest her soul!&mdash;who used to say&mdash;and
many's the time she said it: 'Timmie dear, don't
never disappoint people if you can help it.' And
I never do&mdash;especially when it don't cost me anything;
for water is the only thing I had to bring
into the hall to-night&mdash;and water, gentlemen, is
cheap."</p>

<p>"Yes, an' talk's cheap, too!"</p>

<p>Tim bowed to the voice and smiled with the
laugh that followed.</p>

<p>"God knows it is cheap. If it wasn't 'tisn't the
likes o' me could afford to be handing it out to you
to-night, and no charge for admission at the door."
<span class='pagenum'>[83]</span></p>

<p>"Say, Buck, his ten minutes'll be used up before
ever he gets started!" came a voice from midway
of the hall.</p>

<p>"True for you, boy. And so I'll be introducing
myself. My history is short. Riley is my
name, Timothy Joseph Riley&mdash;baptized by Father
Kiley, in the parish of Ballymallow&mdash;and I'm a
Republican."</p>

<p>"And there's what we'd like to have you tell
us, Misther Riley&mdash;how came you to be a Republican?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you blarneyin' turncoat&mdash;how came ye?"</p>

<p>A man in the front row stood up to say that
last, a rugged-looking man, who looked as if he
would like mighty well to jump up on the stage
and haul Tim down off it. Toward him Tim
stepped, leaning over the edge of the stage so
that the belligerent one would not miss a syllable.</p>

<p>"I'll tell how I came to be a Republican. When
I landed in this country and before I was fairly
out of Castle Garden some thief of a pickpocket
or worse stole the few little dollars I had to keep
me until I could get a job. I was a seventeen-year-old
boy, and that shy I couldn't beg. For
two days not a morsel of food went into my mouth.
And there I was, jumping sideways with the hunger,
when a man comes along and saw me and
brought me into a grand restaurant, 'And how'll
<span class='pagenum'>[84]</span>
I ever pay you?' I asks when I'd eaten my fill.
He was a butcherman, with a white smock on
him. And he laughs and says: 'You can't now;
but by and by, when you get a vote, be sure and
vote the Republican ticket.' And I says: 'Why
the Republican ticket?' And he says: 'Oh, just
by way o' variety&mdash;just to show that you people
don't all go one way.'</p>

<p>"And"&mdash;Tim straightened up&mdash;"I took his
hand, and 'Sir, I will!' I said. He was joking,
maybe; but I wasn't. And I did vote the Republican
ticket; and I'm still voting the Republican
ticket. And I'm saying to you all to-night&mdash;the
one Republican among five hundred of ye&mdash;that
I'm not apologizing to any man in this hall
or any other hall for it. And I'm saying to you"&mdash;in
the face of the inquiring man in the front
row, in the face of Buck Malone, in the face of
the whole hall, Tim clinched his fist&mdash;"I'm saying
that the man of Irish blood who ever forgets
the promise that he's made to the one that befriended
him&mdash;I say to ye all, and I don't care
whether ye like it or not&mdash;his blood's been crossed
somewhere; he's no Irish in him! No&mdash;nor fit to
be called a man at all!"</p>

<p>Tim stepped back to pour out a glass of water;
a form rose up midway of the hall, and a voice
roared out:
<span class='pagenum'>[85]</span></p>

<p>"Say, you Riley man, your politics are the
divil's own, but you're Irish all right. Go on!"</p>

<p>Tim held the glass toward the speaker.</p>

<p>"And, ma bouchal, 'tis you has the Irish heart
in you, too. Here's to you! You stubborn, unconverted,
hereditary Democrat, here's to you!"
He drained the glass.</p>

<p>"Go on! Tell us more!"</p>

<p>"Yes; go on&mdash;talk up!"</p>

<p>"You'll get a show here. Go on!"</p>

<p>Tim glanced down at Buck Malone, swept the
benches for the sight of a more cheerful face and
caught the friendly eyes of Peter Kearney. Also
he suddenly recognized the face of Malone's
henchman&mdash;the man to whom he had given the
cigar. He was wagging his head encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I will go on&mdash;and thank you for
the chance. And, with your permission, gentlemen,
I'll speak of something besides politics. It
is of charity. Gentlemen, a great quality is charity.
Only because of the spirit of charity in you,
gentlemen, am I allowed to speak to you here to-night;
but it's another phase of charity I'd like
to speak of. I will put it in the form of a story&mdash;and,
gentlemen, not too long a story.</p>

<p>"There was an old lady in the old country, who
received a letter from her oldest son, John, with
passage-money for her second son, Pat, to come
<span class='pagenum'>[86]</span>
over and join him. She gave her consent. Why
wouldn't she&mdash;when the living was so hard? Pat
went, leaving his mother of nigh seventy and the
last of his brothers with her. One son had already
gone to South America and another to Australia;
and now only a boy was left to her&mdash;and him
with one leg gone in a railroad accident, for which
they'd never got a farthing."</p>

<p>At this point Tim heard the side door softly
open and close. He took a quick backward peek.
Dinnie and old Nanna Nolan were waiting in the
wings. Tim signed to them to remain there.
He stepped to the front of the stage then, just in
time to see Malone, whose every move he was
watching, uncross his legs and half rise in his seat.
Tim looked at him steadily and waited. Malone
did not move farther, and Tim resumed:</p>

<p>"Well, the two sons in America, strong and
willing, worked side by side, earning their dollar
and a quarter and their dollar and a half a
day, with now and again a day's or a week's layoff
to set them back, but managing always between
them to save four dollars in the week and
send it over every month to the old mother&mdash;until
by and by, she scrimping and saving, too, there
was passage-money for herself and the lad to come
to America. They took the steamer at Queenstown;
and 'twas like a grand dream to them&mdash;until
<span class='pagenum'>[87]</span>
one day there came a great storm and the
ship leaped and jumped, and the poor, helpless,
crippled boy was thrown down an iron ladder; and
when some one thought to help the poor mother
pick him up he was dead. Well&mdash;But, gentlemen,
maybe I'm trying your patience?"</p>

<p>"Go on!" came a voice, and "Go on!" came
another; and then three, four, a dozen voices
called for him to continue.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Well, gentlemen, a tempest in
the great ocean, with its tremendous winds and
mountains of seas, must be a terrible sight; but
surely a more terrible sight is to see that same
ocean, as smooth as oil, and the blue heavens
smiling down, while the body of one that's dear to
you is lowered into it! So it was. With loose,
wide stitches they'd sewed the boy into canvas;
and to the one foot of him they tied a piece of an
old grate-bar, and dropped him into that great
ocean."</p>

<p>Tim saw Malone shoot a furtive glance sideways
to learn how they were taking it in the front
row. Plainly he was not liking it, for he stood up
straight then and surveyed the rows of voters
behind him. Tim waited, and every man there
knew why he waited. There was an indrawing of
breaths all over the hall. Malone, without showing
the ordering forefinger, sat down again.</p>

<p>Tim bowed to him. "Thank you, Mr. Malone,
<span class='pagenum'>[88]</span>
for that fighting chance," which remark brought
out a quick burst of applause.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen, that poor old woman landed
in the strange country. Grief-stricken she was,
but not yet utterly discouraged. The son Pat
was to meet her at the dock. He was not there.
Well, she could see a good reason for that. They
could not leave their work&mdash;sometimes the bosses
were strict&mdash;they had often written so in their
letters. No matter. With not much left of her
little savings, she bought a ticket and took the
train for the town where her two sons were working.
Well, neither was Pat at the station to
greet her&mdash;but by and by she learned why.</p>

<p>"There had been a premature explosion in the
quarries, and a fall of rock had knocked Pat
senseless; and as he lay there, unconscious, a
second blast came and killed him. Well, that was
an awful thing; but still there was the son John.
And they had then to tell her of John. Well,
while Pat lay there helpless, another man had run
in to carry him out of danger. He was a brave
man, that second man, for the flame of the second
fuse was then almost to the charge; but he ran
in and he had the injured man in his arms when
the second explosion came. They were killed together.
That second man was her other son,
John."</p>

<p>Tim paused; but he no longer had to ask their
<span class='pagenum'>[89]</span>
leave to speak. He was in full swing; and out
there, beyond the ends of his nervous, spreading
fingers, they were swinging with him. Sitting up
straight and still they were&mdash;or leaning forward,
bent and eager.</p>

<p>A potent gift, the orator's. A writer may never
hope to achieve instantly his great intention.
He is limited to monotonous-looking black words
on a blank page. But a speaker! Added to the
words are eyes, lips, hands, head, body, and the
immeasurable force of personality. Tim's voice
softened and deepened, halted and quickened,
rounded and trembled; the ruddy cheek took on
a ruddier color; his deep-set eyes grew deeper and
darker, and by and by they flamed. He grew
taller; his body expanded. He spread his hands&mdash;fine,
shapely hands, with nervous, expressive
fingers&mdash;and as he gestured he quivered to his
very finger-tips, and down there on the benches
they quivered with him. The cold words&mdash;he
warmed and revivified them. Under the caress of
his beautiful, barely perceptible brogue the commonest,
harshest lines took on smoothness and
roundness; and from out his mouth the fine, tender
words bloomed like summer flowers; and the
larger, colorful words flashed like gems.</p>

<p>Tim, in short, was an orator. And when he
said: "There, gentlemen, you have the story&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum'>[90]</span>
you know whose story it is. Poor old Nanna
Nolan's&mdash;yes:" when he had said that, with
arms and hands no longer gesturing, but drooping
straight and motionless by his side, no one
stirred&mdash;but a great sigh went up.</p>

<p>And not till that moment did Malone wake up
to it that he had waited too long; but that moment
he desperately chose to take his position at
the end of the aisle and face his hitherto unbroken
constituency; and while Malone was doing that
Tim was motioning to Dinnie in the wings; and
now Dinnie was leading her out&mdash;old Nanna
Nolan, halting and bewildered, blinking at the
audience&mdash;as Tim held up one hand for a last
word.</p>

<p>"Here she is! I've tried to tell you her story,
gentlemen; but there's only one living person
can tell that story right, and I'm not that one. If
you could have heard her telling it&mdash;she in her
little cabin on that windy hillside, before her little
stove, with the dark coming down and the lights
beginning to shine through&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And that instant, while Tim's arm was across
her poor thin shoulders, covered as ever with the
worn man's coat&mdash;that instant Malone, whose
back was to the stage, chose to raise his fateful
forefinger.</p>

<p>And Tim waited. And Malone waited.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[91]</span>
Not a man left the hall.</p>

<p>Malone turned and faced Tim.</p>

<p>"You win," he said; "but that two-faced
chairman of yours&mdash;and he ain't any friend of
yours&mdash;he never tipped me off you could fight
any way except with your hands. Speak the rest
of your piece. You win!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Back at headquarters the state chairman had
been for an hour trying to extract a little comfort
from the newspaper story of the New Ireland
upheaval when the tall boss came in. To the
boss, of course, he had to make some comment,
and he made it.</p>

<p>"This man Riley," he began cautiously, "I've
been trying to discover whether he's a Republican
or a Democrat by what he says here."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"He says: 'Take your leaders: and if they
don't carry out your will fire 'em out! If the
men you have set on high betray you,' he puts
it, 'lasso 'em off their pedestals and set 'em on the
street level again!' If that isn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;government by the people?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to say that, sir."</p>

<p>"Why not? Isn't that what it amounts to?
Let me see your paper, please. H-m! I don't
see what there is here to object to. He is not
<span class='pagenum'>[92]</span>
against a party government; in fact, he's all for
party. Only make sure the party leaders are
honest, he says, in politics, religion, business&mdash;in
everything; and if they do not live up to their
promises read them their lesson. Well, why not?
I think he's right. The people know more than
they did and we might as well reckon with that
new knowledge. The men who don't do that
might as well give up the leadership!"</p>

<p>There was a whole page of it in the New Ireland
<i>Record</i> about Tim. The senator read it all. When
he at last looked up he murmured:</p>

<p>"Raised twelve hundred and odd dollars for
the widow Nolan. That was surely well done!
Two hundred and fifty votes pledged to him before
he left the hall. He surely has the touch!
And Malone says he's going to stick to his contracting
hereafter. Good idea!"</p>

<p>The senator read on: "And Malone also says&mdash;also
says&mdash;H-m!"</p>

<p>The chairman was startled out of his silence.</p>

<p>"I set Malone on to Riley&mdash;to fool him."</p>

<p>"You did!" The senator scratched his beard
with his finger-nails, drew his chin in to his neck
and looked over his pince-nez at the chairman.
"Too bad he misunderstood you&mdash;wasn't it? It
would be so nice if we could give you the credit;
but I'm afraid we'll have to hand it to Riley."
<span class='pagenum'>[93]</span></p>

<p>It was not said loudly; but the tone and the
glint of the eyes&mdash;and the cultured boss stirred
into using slang! The chairman knew that he
might as well pick up his hat and go.</p>

<p>And he did; after he wrote out his resignation
with the big boss dictating it over his shoulder.</p>

<h2><a name="anchor" id="anchor"></a>IN THE ANCHOR WATCH</h2>



<p>The battle-fleet, home from foreign waters,
now lay, within a mile-square, emblazoned
quadrangle, to placid moorings in the bay.</p>

<p>From the after bridge of his own ship Lieutenant
Wickett had been observing in silence the
night life of the fleet, but when from some happy
quarter-deck to windward there floated down the
opening strains of a mellow folk-song, he lifted
his chin from arms crossed on the bridge top-rail
to say to his shore-going friend beside him: "Were
you ever able to listen to a ship's band over water,
Carlin, and not get to feeling homesick?"</p>

<p>"Still the kid, aren't you? How can you be
homesick and you home?"</p>

<p>"I'm not home&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>Just below them the officer of the deck was
roaming the quarter-deck. A ship's messenger
stepped up to him, saluted and said smartly:
"Two bells, sir."</p>

<p>"Strike 'em," came the sharp order; and as the
two bells were striking, from other ships, from
<span class='pagenum'>[98]</span>
windward and leeward, came also the quick,
sharp-toned double stroke.</p>

<p>"Why," asked Carlin, "couldn't they strike
those two bells without bothering that deck
officer?"</p>

<p>"Regulations."</p>

<p>"They're the devil, those regulations, Wickett."</p>

<p>"Worse&mdash;sometimes. You can steer clear of
the devil if you want to." He paused. "And yet
it would soon be a devil of a service without
'em."</p>

<p>A sailor stepped up to the officer of the deck,
and, saluting, said: "Anchor lights burning
bright, sir."</p>

<p>A man in a chief petty officer's uniform stepped
up to the officer of the deck, whereupon Wickett,
sitting up, said: "That's our wireless operator."</p>

<p>"A message for Mr. Wickett, sir," came the
operator's voice.</p>

<p>"You'll find Mr. Wickett on the after bridge,"
the officer of the deck said; and the wireless man
came up the bridge ladder and saluted:</p>

<p>"You raised the <i>Clermont</i>, Wesson?" Wickett's
voice was eagerly anticipatory.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I could not. She has no wireless."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!"</p>

<p>"But I raised the Cape station, and they reported
she passed there on schedule time."
<span class='pagenum'>[99]</span></p>

<p>"On time? Good! Thank you, Wesson; that's
all."</p>

<p>"Were you expecting somebody on the <i>Clermont</i>?"
asked Carlin, when the wireless man had
gone.</p>

<p>"Not really expecting. My home is a thousand
miles from here, and my pay won't allow of my
family travelling around everywhere to meet me.
But I like to dream of rosy possibilities, don't
you?"</p>

<p>A cool night breeze was blowing. Wickett bared
his head to it. Presently he began to hum:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"And it's O you little baby boy<br /></span>
<span>A-dancing on my knee&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Will it be a belted charger<br /></span>
<span>Or a heaving deck to sea?<br /></span>
<span>Is't to be the serried pennants<br /></span>
<span>Or the rolling blue Na-vee?<br /></span>
<span>Or is't to be&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>He turned to Carlin. "When I hear myself singing
that, in my own quarters ashore, then I'm
home&mdash;and not before."</p>

<p>He set to humming softly again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"And it's O you little baby girl<br /></span>
<span>Athwart your mother's lap&mdash;&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Suddenly he asked: "Were you ever away from
home sixteen months?"
<span class='pagenum'>[100]</span></p>

<p>Carlin emphatically shook his head. "No, <i>sir</i>.
A year once. And I don't want to be that long
away again. Were you&mdash;before this cruise?"</p>

<p>"Five years one time."</p>

<p>"F-i-i-ve! Whee-eee! Pretty tough that."</p>

<p>"Tough? More&mdash;inhuman. A man can get
fat on war, but five years from your family&mdash;!"
He raised his face to the stars and whoofed his
despair of it.</p>

<p>"My year away from home," said Carlin,
though not immediately, "was in the Philippines&mdash;where
I first met you&mdash;remember? The night
you landed from the little tug you were in command
of and a bunch of us&mdash;war correspondents
we called ourselves&mdash;were gathered around a big
fire."</p>

<p>Wickett nodded. "I remember. And pretty
blue was I?"</p>

<p>"Not at first. I thought you were the most
care-free kid I'd met in months as you sat there
telling about the funny things that had happened
you and your little war tugboat. But towards
morning, with only the two of us awake, I remember
you as possibly the most melancholy young
naval officer I'd ever met. You started to tell
what a tough life the navy was for the home-loving
officer or man, and I had a special reason
for being interested in that. I had&mdash;I still have&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum'>[101]</span>
nephew with his eye on Annapolis. But just
then reveille blew the camp awake and you went
back to your tugboat."</p>

<p>Wickett smiled, though not too buoyantly, as
he said: "Well, on my next cruise to the East I
could have added a chapter to the story I might
have told you by that overnight camp-fire. And
I will now&mdash;but wait."</p>

<p>A ship's messenger was saluting the officer of
the deck. "Taps, sir."</p>

<p>"Tell the bugler to sound taps," was the brisk
command.</p>

<p>The ship's bugler had already taken position,
heels together and facing seaward, in the superstructure
bulkhead doorway. Looking straight
down, Wickett and Carlin could see him, as,
shoulders lifting and blouse expanding, he put
his lungs into the call. From other ships, as he
called, it was coming also&mdash;the long-noted, melancholy
good night of the war legions.</p>

<p>When the last lingering note drooped out, only
one ship, and she a far-away one, remained; but
from her, finally, on the wings of the night breeze,
the last notes drifted&mdash;gently, sweetly, lonesomely,
to them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"What was keeping me walking the deck or
sitting up around camp-fires nights in the Philippines
<span class='pagenum'>[102]</span>
wasn't Filipinos," began Wickett. "I'd
been in the East a year that time we met, and I
put in another year on top of that in China. A
terrible two years. But even two years in the
East with your heart at home must have an ending.
After all, the earth can only revolve so many
days in one year, though at times I used to believe
she'd quit revolving altogether, had stopped
dead, was only marking time&mdash;'specially nights&mdash;and
that the astronomical sharps weren't on to
her changes. However, at last she'd rolled her
sun up and her sun down the necessary seven
hundred and odd times and I was headed for
home.</p>

<p>"I went out a middy and came back an ensign&mdash;which
is very important. An ensign may not
rate many high rights in the service, but he does
rate a leave of absence. And when my leave
came I flew across the bay to the fort, where
Colonel Blenner&mdash;Doris's father&mdash;was commandant.
And on the way over I had a thousand
visions, dreams, hopes, with of course a million
misgivings, fears, doubts, and so on.</p>

<p>"When I met her I set it down right away that
my misgivings had come true. A fleet of young
artillery officers were man&oelig;uvring within shelling
range of her, and while I didn't expect her to
bound half-way across the drill-ground and throw
<span class='pagenum'>[103]</span>
her arms around my neck, or anything like that,
because she never had bounded down and thrown
her arms around my neck, and wasn't the
bounding-down-and-throwing-her-arms-around-your-neck
sort of a girl anyway; but what I did sort of
hope for was that after a polite little interval she'd
turn the red-caped chaps adrift and say, 'Come
on, Dick, let's sit down here in the corner by ourselves
and have a good talk,' and perhaps later,
before the evening got too old, go for a stroll on
the long walk, same as she used to.</p>

<p>"But she didn't turn any of them loose. She
kept them all about her while she drew me into
the middle of them. But poor me! I'd had no
service at all in the civilized ports and hadn't
seen more than a dozen white women in the whole
two years I'd been gone, and of that dozen had
spoken to only three, while as for these artillery
chaps&mdash;! They made me feel like a six-pound
shell in a big turret magazine. Any one of them
could talk the eye out of my head the best day
I'd ever seen. And the day I came back to her
wasn't the best day I'd ever seen&mdash;not for talking
purposes. I looked at and listened to them,
and kept saying to myself: 'I wonder if they realize
what a lucky lot they are to be able to stay all
the time around where civilized women live?'
But I don't believe they did. They took everything
<span class='pagenum'>[104]</span>
as if 'twas no more than small-arms ammunition
was being served out to them.</p>

<p>"In my room in the hotel that night I began to
chart a few new courses for myself. Before I left
for the East Doris was terribly young and there'd
been no other war heroes hanging around. She
and her mother were then living in a quiet hotel
near my house while her father was off on some
board mission in the West. But now it wasn't
any isolated little country hotel. It was post
quarters, with her father the commandant, and
a parade of young army officers in and out of
those quarters, with squadrons of two and three-stripers
steaming over pretty regularly from the
navy-yard across the bay. And she was two
years older&mdash;a terrible advance, eighteen to twenty,
and I'd been two years gone.</p>

<p>"You said a while ago, Carlin, 'What a kid you
are!' and perhaps I am, though I think I'm an old,
old party myself; but about the time I came back
from the East that first time I must have been a
good deal of a kid. I know now I was. That first
night at the hotel, after I'd been to the fort all
day, I talked to myself in good shape. And I
wound up by saying: 'Well, what do you care?
There are forty nice girls between this hotel and
the post.' But there weren't forty. There were
a hundred, as far as that went, but there was only
<span class='pagenum'>[105]</span>
one that I wanted to see coming over the side of
my ship, and next day when I went to see that
one again I set out to win her. And I'm not going
to give you any history of the courtship of Doris.
I couldn't tell it right if I wanted to, and I don't
want to&mdash;it's our own private story, but she wasn't
trifling when she told me she'd never forget me
before I went East. In a week it all came back,
and once more we were walking under tall pines
and sailing in a beautiful bay. In another week
it was as when I left her&mdash;I had hopes.</p>

<p>"And then came the morning of the last day of
my leave, and as an ensign doesn't rate any
shore duty I knew that next day it would have to
be back to my ship for me; though that same ship
being slated for a neighborly berth with the North
Atlantic fleet, I didn't feel too discouraged. I'd
be within wireless distance at least. But I did
not want to go without a promise. The night
before I couldn't get two minutes together with
her&mdash;there being a reception in her father's quarters
to somebody or other&mdash;but when I was
leaving for the night she had said yes, she'd
come sailing with me in the morning after breakfast.
And I left the hotel at sunrise and went
down to the boat-landing to overhaul the hotel's
little twenty-one-footer to make sure everything
would be all ready for our sail after breakfast.
<span class='pagenum'>[106]</span></p>

<p>"I went through the post grounds to get sight
of her window in passing, and there she was&mdash;all
dressed, and looking out across the bay from their
veranda. 'I was just wondering if you, too, would
be up early this morning, Dick,' she said. 'Do
you think it is going to storm?' And I told her
no, and if it did, what matter? And without
waiting until after breakfast we went off for our
young cruise in the bay.</p>

<p>"I was half hoping it would storm, so I could
show her what I could do with that little boat.
But there was no storm or anything like it. There
did come a squall of wind and I let it come, wearing
the boat around, and letting the main-sheet
run. And she zizzed. And I let her zizz. Nothing
could happen. She was one of those little
craft with a lead keel that you couldn't capsize,
which I explained to Doris, while down on her
side the little thing was tearing a white path in
the blue water. But Doris's people had been
always army people, and she hadn't much faith
in floating contraptions. She clung closer to me;
and the two of us sitting together and nothing
to do but watch the boat go, why&mdash;well, we sat
together and let her go.</p>

<p>"The breeze died down until there wasn't
enough of it to be called a breeze, but that was no
matter. We were still sitting close together and
<span class='pagenum'>[107]</span>
while we sat so, I found courage to tell her what
had been flooding my heart through all those
nights and days in Eastern waters. And we came
back to breakfast engaged. And after breakfast&mdash;"
Wickett unexpectedly turned to Carlin
and said, half shyly: "I suppose you still think
I'm a good deal of a kid to be telling you all
this?"</p>

<p>Carlin nodded in serene agreement. "I always
thought you were a good deal of a kid. I hope
you always will be. God save me from the man
who isn't still a good deal of a kid at thirty. What
did you do after breakfast?"</p>

<p>"After breakfast I went up to see Colonel Blenner,
and found him on his veranda smoking his
after-breakfast cigar before he went over to guard-mount.
He was genial as ever; except that he put
his foot down on an engagement. 'An engagement
means a marriage, or should,' he says, 'and how
can you marry on an ensign's pay? You with
your mess bills and other expenses aboard ship,
and Doris with her quarters ashore&mdash;you would
never meet your bills.'</p>

<p>"I agreed with him, but also argued with him,
and shook him some, but could not quite upset
him. I left him to run back to the hotel to throw
my things together. And there I found a new
complication&mdash;orders were waiting me. I was to
<span class='pagenum'>[108]</span>
be detached from my ship and to take command
of the gunboat <i>Bayport</i>&mdash;and a rust-eaten old
kettle of a <i>Bayport</i> she was, famous for her disabilities;
and I was to sail for Manila next morning
at eight o'clock. Manila! Another jolt. I
sat down and thought it out.</p>

<p>"And when I got talking to myself again, I
said: 'Doris Blenner, you're a great girl&mdash;the
best ever; but you're not superhuman. No man
has a right to expect a girl to be that. You're too
lovable, too human, Doris, to be the superhuman
kind. I'll be away in the East Lord knows how
long&mdash;another two years perhaps&mdash;and there's all
those army chaps always on the job. We'll just
have to be married, that's all there is to that,
before I leave.'</p>

<p>"I was back to the post in time to join a riding-party
after lunch. It was no use my trying to
see her alone riding. But after the ride we slipped
out onto the ramparts of the fort, and there, the
pair of us sitting hand in hand and a sentry a
dozen paces away trying not to see and hear us,
I told her of my orders and then entered my new
plea. 'All for myself, Doris,' I told her. By that
time the sun was low behind us and throwing our
two shadows onto where the water of the bay
came gurgling up against the walls of the fort,
and looking down on our shadows from the fort
<span class='pagenum'>[109]</span>
walls, she said at last she would marry me before
I left, if papa agreed&mdash;and glad one minute and
sad the next, we walked back in the twilight.</p>

<p>"Colors had sounded when we got back, and
the colonel was dressing for dinner; but after
dinner I took him out for a walk. Three laps we
made around the drill-ground and then, halting
him under the clump of willows down by the
outer walls, I plumped it at him&mdash;what it meant
to be away for months and years from your own
people.</p>

<p>"And he heard me through, and said: 'Why,
that's part of the hardship, Richard, in both arms
of the service. In my day, Richard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Pardon, Colonel,' I butted in, 'pardon me,
Colonel, but in your day the army people never
left the country. Even when you were fighting
Indians on the frontier, after all it was only the
frontier and never more than a couple of thousand
miles at the most to get back home. And
when you were through campaigning and back
in garrison, your people could come to see
you. But twelve thousand miles! It isn't as if
a man's within telephone call then. And when
you're not to see your people for that length of
time, there's danger.'</p>

<p>"'Danger?' He stiffens up and takes a peek
at me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[110]</span>
"'Danger, yes sir,' I said. 'I've been out
there in the islands, in a tugboat with her engines
broken down and she drifting onto a beach
where four hundred squatting Moros with Remington
rifles were waiting hopefully for us to come
ashore. Four hundred of them and five of us all
told. But that's not danger, sir,' I hurries on,
'of the kind to scare a man, though it did sicken
me to think I'd never see Doris again, and that
perhaps it would shock her when she heard of it.
But otherwise, sir, that's no danger. But when
a young officer goes a thousand miles up a Chinese
river in command of a gunboat, as I was this last
time&mdash;gone for months on it&mdash;and being commander
was everywhere received as the representative
of a great country by all the governors and
topside mandarins along the route. And they
haven't our idea of things&mdash;a lot of things that
seem wrong to us seem all right to them. They
mean no harm. They intend only to be courteous
and complimentary, and so they strew a fellow's
path with the flowers of ease and pleasure&mdash;if he
forgets himself, there's danger, Colonel,' I said.
'I sail at eight in the morning, sir. I'm to be
gone I don't know how long, perhaps another two
years, and&mdash;Colonel&mdash;I want a home anchor.'</p>

<p>"He said no word till he had finished his cigar.
When he does he drops it at his feet, steps on it
<span class='pagenum'>[111]</span>
to put out the light, and says: 'A good argument
for yourself, Richard, but what of Doris?'</p>

<p>"'Doris has probably done a lot of thinking in
the matter, sir. Why not leave it to Doris, sir?'</p>

<p>"'Of course,' he said, dry as powder, 'Doris
would be disinterested in this case!'</p>

<p>"'Then leave it to her mother, sir.'</p>

<p>"'I see neither logic nor prudence in your
argument, Richard,' he answers at last, 'but I
will leave it to her mother.' And when he said
that, I knew I had won; for, without her ever telling
me, I knew her mother was with us. If I had
told him that, I would only have been telling what
he already guessed, as he told me that same night,
later.</p>

<p>"Anyway, after a minute with Doris and her
mother, I jumped over to the hotel, and from the
side of a most billowy waltz partner I detached
Shorty Erroll to get the ring and the smaller
stores for a proper wedding, and then I went out
to bespeak my own ship's chaplain. I found him
lying in his bunk in his pajamas with a History of
the Tunisian Wars balanced on his chest and a
wall-light just back of his head, and he says:
'Why surely, Dick,' when I told him, but added:
'Though that old sieve of a <i>Bayport</i>, I doubt will
you ever get her as far as Manila,' after which,
carefully inserting a book-mark into the Tunisians,
<span class='pagenum'>[112]</span>
he glides into his uniform and comes ashore with
me.</p>

<p>"And without Doris even changing her dress
we were married&mdash;in the colonel's quarters, with
every officer and every member of every officer's
family on the reservation&mdash;even the children&mdash;standing
by. And the women said, 'How distressing,
Mr. Wickett, to have to leave in the morning!'
and the men said, 'Tough luck, Dick'&mdash;and be
sure I thought it was tough luck, and it would
have been tough luck only by this time the
entire post had got busy and got word to Washington,
and at eleven o'clock, while we were still
at the wedding-supper, word came to delay the
sailing of the gunboat for twenty-four hours.
And that was followed by a telegraphic order
next morning to haul the <i>Bayport</i> into dry dock
and overhaul her."</p>

<p>Wickett, who had been talking rapidly, came to
a full stop, while three bells were striking throughout
the fleet.</p>

<p>"Nine-thirty," said Wickett. "I thought I saw
a steamer's light beyond the breakwater."</p>

<p>Carlin looked where he pointed. "I don't, but
I haven't your eyes. How long was the respite?"</p>

<p>"In ten days they had her afloat again. I
thanked my God-given luck for every flying minute
of those ten days."
<span class='pagenum'>[113]</span></p>

<p>"And did she stay afloat long enough to get to
Manila?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. She wasn't half bad. Needed a little
nursing in heavy weather, but outside of that she
wasn't hopeless at all."</p>

<p>"And what of Mrs. Wickett?"</p>

<p>"She was to come to me just as soon as I cabled
where in the East the gunboat would fetch up for
any sort of a stay. But I was never in one spot
for long. We cruised from Vladivostok to Manila
and back again, never more than a week in any
one place. Even so, as soon as I'd saved enough
out of my ensign's pay, she was to come&mdash;and she
would have&mdash;to meet me; but before enough
months of saving had passed she wrote me. There
was a baby coming, and then I wouldn't let her
come. I did not want her jumping from port to
port in foreign waters before the baby was born,
and she would soon be needing every cent of my
ensign's pay that I could save.</p>

<p>"And the months rolled around and the cable
came which told that the baby had come, and
that Doris and everything was fine; and I was as
happy as a man could be with a wife and boy he
was crazy to see, but couldn't. She wanted to
come out and join me right away, but I said no.</p>

<p>"Well, when the baby was big enough to stand
travel she was coming, anyway, she wrote; but I
<span class='pagenum'>[114]</span>
reminded her that before a great while now I
ought to be on my way home. And one day in
the China Seas I saw the sun between us and the
shore setting under a thousand golden lakes and
pools and purple pillars, and a home-bound pennant
of a full cable's length whipping the breeze
in our smoke astern."</p>

<p>Wickett paused, and resumed: "That was a
great night. It was two years and three months
since I'd left Bayport. The first thing I did in
the morning after turning out, and for every
morning thereafter, was to step to the calendar on
the wall of my room and block out that day's
date with a fat blue-leaded pencil I'd got from
the paymaster for that purpose alone, and then,
estimating the run on the chief engineer's dope,
count how many days were left."</p>

<p>Wickett was silent. He remained silent so long
that Carlin thought that that must be the end,
abrupt though it was, to the story. But it was not
that. Wickett was pointing across the bay.</p>

<p>"See, Carlin&mdash;the flag-ship of the second squadron
has just sent out an order for its first division
to prepare for an emergency signal drill. And
the first division are to have a torpedo drill at
the same time. Wait&mdash;in half a minute it will be
on. There&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>From the mastheads the red and white Ardois
<span class='pagenum'>[115]</span>
lights were winking even as the illuminated arms
of the semaphores were wigwagging jerky messages
from bridge to bridge; on shore, on the
water, on the clouds, the great search-lights swept
and crossed endlessly. It was dazzling. Suddenly
it ceased. "Oh-h!" protested Carlin.</p>

<p>"Life is just like that, isn't it?" said Wickett;
"all light and play and color for a spell, and then&mdash;pff&mdash;lights
out."</p>

<p>"Maybe," admitted Carlin, "but don't impede
the speed of the story. Your ship was racing for
home."</p>

<p>"Our orders were to proceed by way of Suez
and to rendezvous with the battle-fleet at Guant&aacute;namo,
Cuba. We got into Guant&aacute;namo the
day before the <i>Missalama</i> arrived from the North.
The <i>Missalama</i> had orders to proceed to the West
Coast. Half a dozen of the officers already in
Guant&aacute;namo were ordered to her. I was one of
them."</p>

<p>"Good night! But that was a jolt!"</p>

<p>"That's what it was. But that's the service."</p>

<p>"And couldn't you do anything about it?"</p>

<p>"What could I do? There were my orders.
A couple of the fellows came as near to being
politicians then as ever they did in their lives.
They tried to reach people in Washington&mdash;bureau
chiefs, senators, influential congressmen&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum'>[116]</span>
have me detached and ordered home. But next
day was a holiday and the day after was Sunday,
and the ship had to sail by Sunday. And she did,
and I with her."</p>

<p>"And how do you account for your being
shunted off like that? Somebody have it in for
you?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not that. Simply the politicians.
I don't suppose the service will ever be free of the
near-politicians. The navy has them&mdash;fellows
who are not good enough officers to depend upon
themselves alone, and not good enough politicians
to go in for politics altogether. Somebody with a
good shore billet somewhere was probably due for
sea-duty, and not wanting to let go of a good
thing, and having the pull, somebody else went instead.
And somebody else for that somebody
else, and somebody else again, and so on till at
last the somebody else who could be made to
serve a turn happened to be me.</p>

<p>"'Hard luck, Dickie,' said the ward-room mess.
'But cheer up&mdash;in three months you'll see the
Golden Gate, and by then you'll be ready for a
little duty on your home coast. Then your lieutenant's
straps and shore duty, and your wife and
baby to yourself for a while.' I had that thought
to cheer me through the night-watches around
South America, but at Callao we got orders to
<span class='pagenum'>[117]</span>
proceed to Manila, and after six months out that
way it was off to the Island of Guam, and from
there to make a survey of some islands in the
South Sea. No way I could fix it could I tell my
wife to come and meet me at any certain place.</p>

<p>"But no task is endless. We were homeward
bound at last. I remember how I used to say at
mess that I was never going to believe I was home,
till with my own eyes I saw the anchor splash in
a home port. But there it was now&mdash;the anchor
actually splashing in Bayport. I had the bridge
making port, and I remember what a look I took
around me before I turned the deck over to the
executive. From the bridge, with a long glass,
I could see above the tree tops the roof of the
colonel's old quarters. I pictured him on the
veranda below with the baby and Doris waiting
for me. I'd sent a wireless ahead for Doris not
to risk herself or that baby out in the bay with a
fleet of battle-ships coming to anchor. And the
baby! I dreamed of him reaching up his little
hands and calling, 'Papa, papa!' when he saw me.</p>

<p>"Well, everything was shipshape. We were
safe to moorings and I was relieved of the deck
and about to step off the bridge when the word
was passed that somebody was waiting to see me
in the ward-room. And with no more than that&mdash;'Somebody
to see you, sir'&mdash;I knew who it
<span class='pagenum'>[118]</span>
was. The fort boat had come alongside and
people had come aboard&mdash;officers' wives and
families, I knew, but not just who, because the
boat had unloaded aft while I was on the bridge
forward. But I knew.</p>

<p>"The messenger smiled when he told me. The
men along the deck smiled when they saw me
hurrying aft. The marines on the half-deck
smiled as I flew by them. Everybody aboard
knew by this time of my five years from home and
the little baby waiting. Good old Doctor and
Pay, going up to take the air on the quarter-deck,
said: 'Hurry, Dick, hurry!' Hurry? I was taking
the ladders in single leaps. At the foot of the
last one, in the passageway leading to the ward-room,
I all but bowled over a little fellow who was
looking up the ladder like he was expecting somebody.
I picked him up and stood him on his
feet again. 'Hi, little man!' I remember saying,
and thinking what a fine little fellow he was, but
no more than that, I was in such a hurry.</p>

<p>"And into the ward-room, and everybody in
the ward-room that wasn't occupied with some of
his own was smiling and pointing a finger to
where, in the door of my stateroom, Doris was
waiting for me. And I dove through the bulkhead
door, leaped the length of the ward-room
country, and took her in my arms. For a minute,
<span class='pagenum'>[119]</span>
five minutes, ten minutes&mdash;just how long I don't
know&mdash;but I held her and patted her and dried
her tears.</p>

<p>"'And where's little Dick?' I asked at last.</p>

<p>"'Why, that was Dick you stood on his feet
in the passageway,' she said, and laughed to think
I didn't know him. 'But that's because he looks
so much like you and not me. No man knows
what he looks like himself,' she said, and ran and
got Dick, and brought him to me, and said: 'Dick,
here's your papa.' And Dick looked at me and he
said: 'No, mama, that is not my papa. My papa
has no legs,' just as I was going to fold him in my
arms and hug him to death.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;will you still think I was only a kid?&mdash;I
stepped into my room and drew the curtains,
and sat down by my bunk and cried. After five
years! And Doris came in, and perhaps she wanted
to cry, too, but she didn't. She drew a photograph
from her bosom and showed it to me. It
was the only one of me that ever suited her, and
it happened to be only a head and shoulders, and
every day since the baby was old enough she had
told him: 'That's your papa, dear, and some day
he'll come home in a great big war-ship with guns
and guns, and then you'll see.' And the poor
little kid, four years and three months old, had
never seen any legs on the man in the photograph;
<span class='pagenum'>[120]</span>
but he had seen his mother cry almost
every time she looked at it, and he supposed
that was why she cried&mdash;because papa had no
legs. And so the poor kid was waiting to see a
man with no legs."</p>

<p>Wickett was silent. Carlin asked no more
questions. In silence he, too, studied what was
left of the night-life of the fleet. Only the white
anchor-lights of the motionless battle-ships, the
colored side-lights of the chugging steam-launches,
were now left.</p>

<p>Carlin pointed out to Wickett a green light
coming rapidly in from sea. "Another battle-ship,
Wickett?"</p>

<p>Wickett shook his head. "No. I've been
watching her. It's the <i>Clermont</i>. She's due.
And I'm half afraid to go and board her."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"If my wife's aboard, she'll have with her a
fifteen-months-old daughter that I have never
seen. Suppose she, too, greets me with&mdash;She's
swinging back&mdash;to her anchorage&mdash;look."</p>

<p>The green light rolled in a great half-circle inshore,
and disappeared. A red light curved into
sight.</p>

<p>Wickett jumped up. "Come on, Carlin, I'll
get permission to leave the ship. We'll be there
before she lowers the port ladder."
<span class='pagenum'>[121]</span></p>

<p>"No, but drop me at the landing on the way
and I'll see you in the morning at the hotel.
How's that?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Carlin saw him before the morning. He was
in the lobby of the hotel when Wickett with his
wife, a fine big boy, and a lovely little baby girl,
got out of the hotel 'bus. The boy was clinging to
Wickett's hand, all the while talking rapturously
of the trip of the <i>Clermont</i>. With his free arm
Wickett was carrying the baby, which was murmuring,
"Papa, papa, papa!"</p>

<p>Carlin would have known Mrs. Wickett without
an introduction or the presence of the boy
and the baby. Merely from the way she looked at
Wickett he knew that this was the girl who had
gone sailing with him in the dawn and become
engaged before breakfast.</p>

<p>"It's all right," smiled Wickett, with his cheek
against the baby's. "This one can't seem to
say anything but papa!"</p>

<p>Carlin nodded, and whispered: "And you
couldn't afford it?"</p>

<p>Wickett grinned. "We couldn't; but we did.
We always do."</p>

<p>"And how about the service&mdash;going to quit
it?"</p>

<p>Wickett stared at Carlin. "Quit the service!"
<span class='pagenum'>[122]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly he recalled, and laughed, and whispered:
"Sh-h&mdash;! I'm due for a year and a half of shore
duty. But don't mind if I hurry along, will you?
I got to get these children to bed."</p>

<p>"Go on&mdash;hurry&mdash;and good night," said Carlin.
"Good night, Mrs. Wickett," and handed
her into the elevator; and smoked two thoughtful
cigars on the veranda and then went inside and
sat down and wrote a long letter on the subject
of the navy as a profession to the mother of a
young lad back home.</p>

<p>There was much detail, and then:</p>

  <blockquote>As to being away from home for long periods: Married
  officers tell me that it is hard at times. But judging by what
  I saw awhile ago here, the home-coming almost offsets the
  long absences. The kind of a woman they marry probably
  makes a lot of difference. I'd say, let him go if he wants to.
  Good night.<br />

<h2><a name="crosscourses" id="crosscourses"></a>CROSS COURSES</h2>


<p>Hearing the boys in the office talking of a
lecture at the Sailor's Haven a few nights
ago was what set me thinking to-day. It was on
superstition, and the speaker digressed to expend
ten minutes, as he put it, on sailors. A most
superstitious lot, sailors.</p>

<p>He had a lot of fun with the sailors, and a
crowd of old seafaring men sat there and let
him, until a boss stevedore from our wharf who'd
been one time mate of a coaster, with the preliminary
contribution that this was sure the wisest
party he'd listened to in all o' seven years, rose
to inquire of the gentleman how long he'd been
to sea.</p>

<p>Well, he had been to sea quite a little. Twice
to Europe and return, once to Panama and return,
once to Jamaica in the West Indies and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;return?" finishes our stevedore. "Sure
you returned each time? 'N' in what sortivver
craft'd you sail to them places&mdash;and return&mdash;in?"</p>

<p>"Why, steamers," answers the lecturer.
<span class='pagenum'>[126]</span></p>

<p>"Passinjer?"</p>

<p>"Passenger? Certainly."</p>

<p>"Excuse <i>me</i>!" says our stevedore. "I oughter
known better. O' course, <i>you know</i> all about
sailors," and sits down.</p>

<p>The lecturer was all right. He was doing the
best he knew, with the finest and fattest of words
he could pick out, to make things clearer to his
audience; and his audience, appreciating that,
let him run on, until he said that there was not
one mysterious thing which had ever happened
that could fail to be proved very ordinary by
mathematical, or historical, or logical, or physical,
or some other "cal" deduction; which bounced
our watch-dog out of his seat again.</p>

<p>"How d'you 'count," he growls, "for th' <i>Orion</i>
'n' <i>Sirius</i>?"</p>

<p>Well-l, he could not account for it, for the simple
and overwhelmingly conclusive reason that,
previous to that very moment, he had never
heard of the ships named.</p>

<p>"Then s'pose you hear 'f 'em now," says our
stevedore, and starts in and delivers the lecturer
a lecture on the <i>Orion</i> and <i>Sirius</i>, and it
wound up the show; for when the lecturer started
to butt in, all the old barnacles, who before this
had been clinging warily to the edge of their
seats, now rose up and rallied around our stevedore
<span class='pagenum'>[127]</span>
to finish his story, which he did; and the old
fellows, on leaving the hall, said that the credit of
the proceeds for the Sailor's Haven fund, for that
night, anyway, ought to go as much to their old
college chum from the coal wharf as to any imported
lecturer with his deckload of lantern slides.</p>

<p>But our stevedore didn't tell all there was of
the <i>Orion</i> and the <i>Sirius</i>. The lecturer went home
thinking he had been told all about it, but he
hadn't. Here it is as it was.</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>In the fleet of big coal schooners, which at this
time were running from the middle Atlantic ports
to Boston, the twin five-masters, the <i>Orion</i> and
the <i>Sirius</i>, were notable.</p>

<p>They were twins in everything: built from the
one set of moulds in the one yard at the one time,
launched together, rigged together, sailed on their
maiden trips together, and were brought home
with their first cargoes of coal together by two
masters who were almost as twinlike to look at
as their vessels.</p>

<p>It was the history of these two big schooners,
that they seemed always to be wanting to get together.
Their crews used to say of them that if
left anchored at all near each other in the stream,
<span class='pagenum'>[128]</span>
they would start right away to swing toward each
other. Even if it was slack water they would.
Yes, sir.</p>

<p>I can't speak from personal knowledge of that
tide-swinging trick, but I do know that I saw them
a few hours after they had twice smashed into
each other&mdash;once under sail off the Capes and once
in tow up Boston Harbor; and it was not to be
doubted that in both cases they had more than
drifted into each other. And of their near-collisions!
A day's loaf along the water-front would
yield gossip of a dozen or more.</p>

<p>Now, these next few lines are from out of the
sailors' book of gossip of mysterious happenings
at sea; and it is true that the more sailorly the
gossip, the more likely will it be to try to account
for unusual accidents at sea in a natural way;
and the most usual reason given is inefficiency&mdash;lack
of seamanship. As to that, it is true that
lack of seamanship or of sea instinct has accounted
for many calamities at sea, and the same lack
would probably account for many another not so
set down on the public tablets; but lack of seamanship
won't account for all the queer happenings
at sea. Every now and then comes a ship
which no earthly power seems able to keep up
with. From out of our superior shore knowledge
we may deduce that the builder or designer was
<span class='pagenum'>[129]</span>
in fault, that there must have been an asymmetry
in her hull, or that her rigging lacked balance, such
defects tending to render her uncontrollable under
certain conditions. Maybe; but there she is,
as she is, with the malign fates seeming to be
working double tides to get her.</p>

<p>"Hoodoo ships," sailors term such, and "Hoo-doos,
both of 'em," the crews of the collier fleet
early labelled the <i>Orion</i> and the <i>Sirius</i>. Yes, <i>sir</i>.
And some day the pair of them were going up&mdash;or
down&mdash;in a whirl of glory. If only they would
smash only each other, and not go to putting
poor innocent outsiders out of commission when
they did go!&mdash;that was all they'd ask of <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>The master of the <i>Orion</i> was Oliver Sickles; of
the <i>Sirius</i>, Norman Sickles; and they were from
the same little hamlet in that Cape Shore region
whence come so many capable sailormen. Each
was named for his father, and their fathers were
brothers who hated each other and brought up
their children to hate each other.</p>

<p>It was curious to see them&mdash;two master mariners
commanding sister ships for the same owners&mdash;passing
each other on the wharf, brushing
elbows in the office, putting to sea time and time
together, sailing, again and again, side by side for
days together, and yet never seeming to see each
other. Indifference was the word; but if by any
<span class='pagenum'>[130]</span>
chance a third person referred to one in the presence
of the other in anything like complimentary
terms, that third person was soon let to know
that he wasn't making any hit with whichever
Captain Sickles it was who had to listen. If it
was Norman of the <i>Sirius</i>, he would shift his feet
and start to stare intently at the ceiling or the
sky; if it was Oliver of the <i>Orion</i>, with a snarl
of disgust he would get up and walk off.</p>

<p>I had heard a lot of the Sickles cousins, but had
never had more than a hailing acquaintance with
either of them, until this early fall when my firm
chartered, among others, the <i>Orion</i> and the <i>Sirius</i>,
and sent me down to Newport News to see that
they lost no time in loading and getting out. It
was the time of a threatened coal famine in New
England, with coal freights up to two dollars a
ton, and my firm chartering everything they could
get hold of to take the coal from the railroads at
Newport News and rush it east.</p>

<p>In our two new schooner captains, Norman and
Oliver Sickles, I found, when I came to have dealings
with them, a pair who knew their business.
Implacable toward each other they surely were,
but so long as their feelings weren't delaying their
sailing days, that was their own business. Tall,
broad, powerful chaps they both were, twenty-eight
or thirty years of age to look at, slow in
<span class='pagenum'>[131]</span>
thought, heavy in action, but competent sailormen
always. I had no need to know their records,
nor to talk with them too many hours, to
find that out. Not much about a schooner, be
she two or five master, nor much about the North
Atlantic coast, that they didn't know.</p>

<p>I had been three months in Newport News,
Christmas was at hand, and the railroad people
were telling me that they would have no more
coal for my firm until after New Year's. There
were twenty thousand tons not yet gone; but if
my four four-master schooners could sail next
morning, and the five-masters, <i>Orion</i> and <i>Sirius</i>,
get away the morning after, that twenty thousand
tons would be cleaned up.</p>

<p>I hunted up the Captain Sickles of the <i>Sirius</i>
and put the question to him: "Captain Norman,
if I can get you loaded and cleared by the morning
after to-morrow, what's the chance of your
making Boston by Christmas?" And he answered,
after some thought: "It's a westerly
wind with a medium glass to-day. It ought to
hang on westerly and dry for another four or five
days. Clear me by the morning after to-morrow,
and I'll lay the <i>Sirius</i> to anchor in Boston
Harbor Christmas Eve, or"&mdash;he was a man of
serious ways, and spoke most seriously now&mdash;-"or
I'll give you a good reason why."
<span class='pagenum'>[132]</span></p>

<p>I hunted up Captain Oliver Sickles of the <i>Orion</i>,
and I found him having a drink in the bar of the
Tidewater Caf&eacute;. He looked as if he'd welcome
a quarrel, but that was nothing strange in him.
I put the same question to him that I had put to
his cousin, and the answer came in almost the
same words as to the medium glass and the
westerly wind, but at that point he looked sharply
at me.</p>

<p>"And when does the <i>Sirius</i> sail?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The morning after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And"&mdash;suspiciously&mdash;"who first that morning,
the <i>Sirius</i> or me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. You'll be loaded and cleared
together&mdash;it's for yourselves to say who sails
first."</p>

<p>"And what did he say?"</p>

<p>Captain Oliver had a hectoring way about him
which used to make me promise myself that some
day, after he'd done hauling coal for my outfit,
I'd tell him what I thought of him. "What did
who say?" I asked him now.</p>

<p>"Warn't you talkin' to my cousin awhile ago
about the same thing?"</p>

<p>"I was, though I don't remember telling you
about it."</p>

<p>"H-m," he sneered, "I thought so. Y' always
go to him first."
<span class='pagenum'>[133]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" I snapped at him. "And why?
Because he knows his mind. And he's a man to
give an answer without using up an afternoon
talking about it. He said he'd have the <i>Sirius</i>
to anchor in Boston Harbor by Christmas Eve or
give me a good reason why."</p>

<p>"He did, did he? Then set this down in your
log"&mdash;with the end of a prodigiously thick forefinger
he was tapping the bar as he said it:&mdash;"The
<i>Orion</i> will be laying to anchor in Boston Harbor
by Christmas Eve or there'll be a <i>damn</i> good reason
why."</p>

<p>Right here I should say that there was more
than a rivalry of craftsmanship between the Sickles
cousins. Once, thinking it was the <i>Sirius</i>,
Norman Sickles's sweetheart, a very pretty and a
very good girl, had gone aboard the <i>Orion</i> as it
lay in Boston Harbor. Oliver at once locked her
in the cabin, put to sea, and carried her to Philadelphia,
where, urged by her mother, and to save
her good name as she thought, she married Oliver.
But that her heart was still with Norman was current
gossip in the fleet.</p>

<p>Because he had lately heard that I had been
free-spoken in my comment on that exploit was
why Captain Oliver now&mdash;his forefinger tapping
the bar and he eying me from under his hat-brim&mdash;added
to his "good reason" the word that,
<span class='pagenum'>[134]</span>
no matter what my firm or any other firm
thought of this or that, which warn't none o'
their business anyway, he wanted 'em all to understand
that he was as capable of getting a
quick passage out of a vessel as any Norman
Sickles that ever walked; which gave me a fine
chance to say: "Well, the place to prove that is
at sea, and not in a barroom ashore."</p>

<p>Not very delicate&mdash;no; but it sent him almost
on the run down aboard his vessel, to clear his
decks for loading, which was mostly what I was
after.</p>

<p>And I let it leak out&mdash;the answer of the two
cousins about being in Boston before Christmas.
A little rivalry of that kind doesn't do any harm;
and I wanted to walk into the office on Christmas
Eve and say, "The last of that Newport News
coal is lying out there in the stream waiting to
dock," and then go home, even as many of the
crews would want to go home, with an easy conscience
for a Christmas holiday.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>People in my line used to say that I was pretty
young for my job, and some of them to warn me
about allowing the underlings to get familiar with
me. Well, perhaps I was too young for my job,
<span class='pagenum'>[135]</span>
or for any other job of any account; but as to the
other charge I never noticed anybody getting
over-familiar with me. Friendly, yes; but even
the head of the firm himself couldn't get over-familiar
unless I let him.</p>

<p>Part of my job, as I figured it, was to know
freights and ships and the masters of ships; and
where it hurt the firm's interests if I knew the
crews as well, I couldn't see. Some would tell
me that the further away I kept from them the
more highly they would respect me, and the more
highly they respected me the more they would do
for me, which would have listened well if their
vessels were getting in and out of loading ports
any faster than mine did; but nobody noticed
that they were.</p>

<p>And beyond that: I could never see where a
little friendliness to anybody did any harm. I
may have been too young for my job, but I wasn't
too young to know that the world is alive with
unassuming little fellows who are full to the
hatches with knowledge of one kind or another
that they will cheerfully unload to anybody who
has time for them. Not that I want anybody to
think I am so long-headed or forehanded a chap
as to spend time only with people who could tell
me things! I didn't do any thinking about it one
way or the other. Any man that had time for
me, I had time for him.
<span class='pagenum'>[136]</span></p>

<p>I had time for Drislane. He was one of the
crew of the <i>Sirius</i>, and I had been seeing quite a
little of him while I was in Newport News this
fall on the coal. The <i>Sirius</i> would load, sail, and
return; load, sail, and return; and between trips
Drislane and I would have sessions.</p>

<p>I'd seen something of Drislane before this in
Boston. His mail used to come addressed to our
Boston office, where everybody knew that twice
a year, toward the end of June and just before
Christmas, a check would come to him from his
home in the West. When he came up from the
vessel after a trip and found that home envelope
awaiting him, he would step around to his room,
clean up, and in his shore-going suit of clothes
come back, have us cash his check, and then, according
to our office force, it was&mdash;Good night!
for two weeks.</p>

<p>The check, always the same&mdash;for twelve hundred
dollars&mdash;would have given him a good two
weeks' whirl in highly-rated, expensive places, if
he cared for splurge, but I guess he never was influenced
much by regulation ratings. Any place
he liked the looks of would do for him&mdash;and some
perhaps that he didn't like the looks of.</p>

<p>It was no use to try to tell the office force that
Drislane hadn't a weak joint somewhere. Man,
they <i>knew</i>! and holding no berths for the purely
spiritual, with but one suspicious and unexplained
<span class='pagenum'>[137]</span>
action to work from, would build you up a character
of any depth of depravity you were pleased
to have. Three guesses, no more, was all they
needed for Drislane's case. It was rum, or women,
or rum <i>and</i> women. If neither, then there was no
hope for him at all&mdash;he was insane.</p>

<p>And certainly his judgment in women was
something fierce. I'm setting down now the diction,
as well as the judgment, of the office force;
this last judgment being based on the evidence of
the two illuminated occasions when he had come
in to cash his check, and each time brought with
him a young woman. Naturally, on his departure,
the lads in the office had a word to say. The only
way they could account for his selections&mdash;well,
they couldn't account for them. It must be a
genius he had&mdash;something was born with him&mdash;to
pick the homely ones.</p>

<p>There wasn't the least evidence to show that
there was anything wrong in these companionships
of his. My notion of it was&mdash;he would never
speak of it&mdash;that he picked up any kind of people
in any kind of place, and made them as happy as
he could while his money lasted. He certainly
never went off for any two weeks' jamboree.
Whatever his experiences were, they seemed to
leave him in good shape physically, anyway. At
least the marks of too many lonesome hours
<span class='pagenum'>[138]</span>
seemed to be ironed out of his face when he came
back.</p>

<p>The man was so everlastingly unconscious that
he was different from anybody else that it was refreshing.
But there was more than that&mdash;to me,
at least. I always looked on him as a touchstone,
one of those men by whom you may gauge other
men. Drislane was sensitized to crooks. He
had only to stand in the same room with them to
get their moral pictures. If I heard of Drislane
distrusting a man or of a man disliking Drislane,
I would at once set that man down, knowing
nothing of the man, as having a rotten spot in
him somewhere.</p>

<p>That was the Drislane who met me this night
before the <i>Sirius</i> and the <i>Orion</i> were to sail for
their last coal trip of the year, and asked me to
have supper with him. And he took me to that
same place where I'd had the words with Captain
Oliver Sickles the day before&mdash;that is, the
Tidewater Caf&eacute;&mdash;where was a drinking bar in
front and a restaurant in back, a common enough
sort of place, where women of the street could&mdash;and
did&mdash;bring drunken sailors, and they served
you pie with a knife.</p>

<p>I speak of that item of serving pie with a knife,
not by way of poking fun at anybody; but here
was a man five years away from his inland hills,
<span class='pagenum'>[139]</span>
for a whole year owner of an eating-place in a
good-sized seaport city, and had not yet noticed
that some people ate pie without a knife. By it
I fancied I could gauge the man's social inheritance.
And there were other customs of the place
in keeping with the pie and knife. I used to speculate
on what primitive sort of an upbringing he
had that he was so slow to adopt the most ordinary
civilized customs.</p>

<p>Drislane seemed to be at home in the place.
So was I for that matter; by which I mean I felt
safe enough. Several times before this, in my
inquisitive ramblings about the port, I had looked
in there. So far as that goes, there are not many
places where they bother a man who doesn't
bother them, always excepting, of course, that he
doesn't get drunk and disorderly, and isn't naturally
foolish.</p>

<p>While I was studying the place and the people,
Drislane ordered supper. I paid no attention to
him until he joggled my elbow. "What do you
think of her?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Which one?" I asked, and looked about me
afresh to note what worshipful creature it was I
had missed.</p>

<p>"You didn't notice," he said, plainly put out
with me, "the girl who is waiting on us?"</p>

<p>I had noticed her; but when she reappeared with
<span class='pagenum'>[140]</span>
the first part of our order, I noticed anew. A tall,
full-bosomed girl she was, and as she walked
across the floor toward us, a load of table things
in each hand, she swayed from her hips like a
young tree in the wind.</p>

<p>The physical force and poise of the girl was
the notable thing about her. She carried her
armfuls of dishes and food as if they were handfuls
of marshmallows. She must have spent
years working like a man in the fields to have
developed such physical power. As to her face&mdash;it
was innocent as a child's.</p>

<p>He introduced me when she had set down her
dishes. "Miss Rose"&mdash;&mdash;I didn't get her surname,
and it doesn't matter. "Rose's uncle owns
this place," he added.</p>

<p>"Poor girl!" I thought.</p>

<p>She met his enchanted gaze with a slow, red-lipped
smile. To me she gave an embarrassed,
half-sidewise glance. Strange men as yet were
evidently disturbing items in her life.</p>

<p>He watched her when she left us, until she had
passed through the kitchen-door and beyond
sight. "I'm going to marry and settle down," he
said.</p>

<p>"This young lady?"</p>

<p>"If she'll have me. I haven't asked her yet."
He was fiddling with his bread and butter. Suddenly
<span class='pagenum'>[141]</span>
he burst out with: "If you knew how lonesome
I used to get, and the things I was tempted
to do to forget it!"</p>

<p>"A man doesn't need, son, to be entirely exiled
from his family to believe that; but when you're
married will you go to sea just the same?" I
asked.</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>I felt sorry for him. She looked to be a good
girl, but I foresaw her troubles in a place like this
while he would be away to sea. It would be a
constant fight. She was possibly nineteen; she
didn't look like a girl who had been tempered by
temptation's long siege, and Lord knows what resisting
power she would develop when so tempted.</p>

<p>From the fragments Drislane fed me with while
she was coming and going, I learned that both her
parents were dead, that she had been in the city
only three months, that her uncle didn't seem to
see anything strange in her employment in his
place, and that Drislane was the first man who
had shown an honest interest in her. "I take
her to the theatre regularly," said Drislane. "I
would to-night, only I want to sit in somewhere
and have a long talk with her. You'd be surprised
the things she doesn't know about the
world."</p>

<p>"I wonder," I thought to myself, "if you realize
<span class='pagenum'>[142]</span>
the things <i>you</i> don't know about the world,"
and began to wish then for his own sake that he'd
hurry up and take to looking at life through the
same glasses other people used.</p>

<p>She was living in sordid quarters in a section
where a woman was any man's who could get her,
and on any terms he could get her; and she was of
the type and at the age which has always been
held most desirable by the primitive male; and
it was to be doubted if she had had the religious
or home training needful to an emotional nature.
In a good home, in a community where a woman
was respected because she was a woman, all
would have been fine; but here&mdash;they married,
and he most of the time at sea&mdash;I felt sorry for
her as well as for him.</p>

<p>"Take her out of here when you marry," I
said to him before parting.</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, I had a scrap with
my people leaving home. They're all right at
home&mdash;the best&mdash;but they want me to get down
on my knees to them."</p>

<p>"Better be on your knees of your own will to
your own people than against your will to an
enemy," I said, but it had no meaning to him;
and I left him to his Rose, almost wishing that
something would happen to him soon to shake
him up, even if, shaking him up, it shook off a
<span class='pagenum'>[145]</span>
few of the purple blossoms that he thought so
necessary to the tree of life. Thinking of him I almost
talk like him in his absent-minded moments.</p>



<h3>III</h3>

<p>I left Drislane to go to the theatre with Captain
Norman Sickles. The theatre over, he went
with me to my hotel to get a few ship's papers I
had for him. After that we sat in for a smoke
and a chat.</p>


<p>We talked until Captain Norman thought it
was time for him to be getting back aboard his
vessel and turning in. As he stood up to go, he
said: "'Tis said you like a little sea trip now and
again? Why don't you go home with me in the
<i>Sirius</i>?"</p>

<p>I was pleased at that&mdash;he was known to be not
over-free with his invitations&mdash;and I thanked him,
but on my not saying yes or no at once he looked
chagrined; seeing which, I explained that early
that fall his cousin had invited me, if ever I cared
to return to Boston by water, to take passage
with him on the <i>Orion</i>.</p>

<p>He tried to smile. He was a whale of a man,
<span class='pagenum'>[145]</span>
bashful in his ways. He smiled like an overgrown
boy who had done something there was
no harm in but of which he was ashamed. "He
always appears to be gettin' in ahead o' me,
don't he?" he said, wistfully-like, after a moment,
which hurried me into saying: "But I never said
I'd go with him, captain, and he probably thinks
he knows me too well to ask me now. I want to
go with you, captain, and"&mdash;I made up my mind
then and there&mdash;"I will&mdash;and proud to have you
ask me."</p>

<p>"Good!" 'Twas a real smile now. "And if
the <i>Orion</i> hauls out with us you may see a wet
passage, and maybe a bit of excitement of one
kind or another before we make Boston Light."</p>

<p>We shook hands on the hope of a fast run to
Boston, and then, drawing from my suit-case a
package of receipts, coal memoranda, and so on,
I held them up. "For the <i>Orion</i>, captain. Where
do you suppose I'll find your cousin this time of
night to give them to him?"</p>

<p>"Where but the Tidewater where that girl
is?"</p>

<p>I stopped to put one thing to another. "And
he is after that red-haired Rose, too?"</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"But doesn't she know, or doesn't her uncle
know, that he's a wife in Boston?"
<span class='pagenum'>[146]</span></p>

<p>"Her uncle!" he snorted. "He's no more wit
than my ship's cat."</p>

<p>"But Drislane knows&mdash;won't he tell her?"</p>

<p>"He don't seem to. A proud one, Drislane.
Six months he's been with me now in the <i>Sirius</i>,
and if she isn't sure she wants him above anybody
else on this earth, then she needn't have him,
that's all; or leastwise, that's how I sense him.
He wouldn't take no odds of the devil, that lad."</p>

<p>I could believe that; and it set me to thinking.</p>

<p>"Maybe you're thinkin' now," he went on,
"that she should be able to see for herself what
my cousin is? But what training has she had to
judge o' men? What other kind does she see
aught of in her uncle's place? Indeed, with her
bringing up and what brains the poor girl has,
she's done very well, I'm thinkin', to ha' kept off
the rocks as long as she has. A hundred to one
you'll find my fine cousin at the Tidewater to-night.
But I must be going. Good night to
you."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Only the bartender was in the front room of the
Tidewater, and he was so busy peeking through
a slide in the wall, the same through which he
passed the drink orders from the restaurant, that
he did not hear me come in. The door to the inner
room was closed, but the low-powered roars
<span class='pagenum'>[147]</span>
of people trying hard not to be noisy were oozing
through.</p>

<p>"What's doing?" I called to the bartender. I
had to call it twice to make him turn around.</p>

<p>"It's the big captain of the <i>Orion</i> and that little
deck-hand Drislane."</p>

<p>Anybody taking Drislane for a joke always did
get my goat. "He's not a deck-hand!" I bit out,
"he's a seaman, and a good one. But what about
him and Captain Sickles?"</p>

<p>"It's about him an' the boss's Rose. The captain
begins to abuse Drislane somethin' fierce,
an' he comes back at him. Then the captain
brings her into it. 'What would a girl be wantin'
with a little runt like you?' he says; and after
that, 'I dunno but I'll take her to Boston with me
this trip,' and said it like he meant it. An' the
little Drislane he jumps into him two-handed, an'
they're hard at it now."</p>

<p>I squeezed inside the door of the inner room.
"Man-to-man fashion!" I could hear, in the
powerful voice of Captain Oliver, while I was
crowding through the ring of people to the open
space in the middle of the floor. "That's it&mdash;man
fashion wi' the naked fists!" some scattering
voices echoed.</p>

<p>Man-to-man fashion! As if man could invent
an unfairer scheme to settle private quarrels!
Give a man heavy muscles and huge knuckles,
<span class='pagenum'>[148]</span>
tough hide and thick skull, add half the courage
of a yellow dog, and how can he lose at that game?
The old-time duellists with their swords were a
hundred times fairer. A long sword to his wrist
and the smallest man had a chance; which is as
it should be, or else we might as well pick some
seven-foot, solid-skulled savage from out of the
jungle and set him up for king.</p>

<p>Man to man! Drislane was five foot six and
weighed, possibly, a hundred and thirty-five
pounds, and was no boxer. Sickles was six foot
three and weighed two-fifty. He had enormous
muscles and knuckles of brass. His hide was
thick and hard as double-ought canvas. Drislane
could have stood off and pounded on his ribs
for a week and hardly black-and-blued them. He
could have swung on him for a month and not
knocked him over.</p>

<p>It was the old-fashioned style of stand-up
fighting. No regular rounds with a rest between.
The men rushed and slugged and clinched and
tugged, and when they fell, got up and went at
it again. Always, when they went to the floor,
Sickles let his two hundred and fifty pounds drop
limp and heavy on Drislane. Drislane would
almost flatten out under it. Standing up, when
Sickles's fist landed on him he would wince all
over. He felt pain like a girl.</p>

<p>It was slaughter. Blood, blood, blood; and
<span class='pagenum'>[149]</span>
the blood all on one side. For perhaps twenty
times Drislane was knocked flat. If Sickles had
only the explosive spark to go with those tremendous
blows he wouldn't have had to hit Drislane
more than once. But he could only continue
to knock the little man flat; and knocking him
flat often enough, the pounding finally told.</p>

<p>The time came when Drislane could not rise
to his feet. He worked himself up to one knee,
with the big man waiting for him to look up so he
might deliver the blow more sweetly. Drislane,
knowing to the full what was coming, looked up
and took all there was of it.</p>

<p>This time he lay flat and quiet. The triumphant
Sickles bent over him. "Y'are satisfied,
are yuh?"</p>

<p>Sickles wasn't going to stop with beating him
up. Drislane must proclaim his conqueror's victory
and his own defeat. Possibly he wanted the
girl Rose to hear it. She had been standing back
on a box in the kitchen doorway and must have
seen most of the fight. I was wondering how far
the joy of battle would mount in her primitive
nature; but when I looked up to note that, and
how she took Drislane's beating, she had gone.</p>

<p>"Are yuh? Speak up!&mdash;are yuh?" bellowed
Sickles.</p>

<p>Drislane by now could open his eyes. He looked
<span class='pagenum'>[150]</span>
up at his conqueror but would not say the word.
Sickles dug the toe of his shoe into his side.</p>

<p>I had been waiting, half sick to my stomach,
for a good excuse to butt in. I had marked, when
I first came in, a piano-stool setting upside down
atop of the piano to one side of the room. In
these possibly rough-house wind-ups it never does
any harm to note where a few little articles of
warfare may be picked up in a hurry. This
piano-stool had a two-inch oak seat.</p>

<p>"You wunt, heh?" Sickles lifted his foot.</p>

<p>"No, he won't!" I butted in, and as he straightened
up to see who it was, I went on: "And
don't think I'll be foolish enough to go staving in
my good knuckles on you. See this little wherewithal
I'm holding, and not too loosely, by the
wind'ard leg? You've a fine thick skull, but this
is thicker. One cute little wallop o' this amidships
of your ears, and it's little you'll care whether
you take the <i>Orion</i> out on the first or the last of
the flood-tide to-morrow. Let him be!"</p>

<p>Now, don't let anybody think I was making a
play for any Carnegie medal thereby. I knew
Oliver Sickles, and even better did I know his
kind, who only go to battle when certain victory
lies before them. The only chance I was taking
was with my firm's interests. It might be that
he'd have such a grouch against me that he'd
<span class='pagenum'>[151]</span>
carry no more coal for my firm than he could help
in future.</p>

<p>He let him be. He put on his collar and coat,
and received as his due the applause of that
crawling breed which are never by any chance
seen shaking hands with anybody but a winner.
While he was still at the hand-shaking I threw
him his ship's papers.</p>

<p>I had the bartender order a carriage, and while
waiting I tried to cheer up Drislane. I told him
that he must not think of going to sea next day,
that I would see Captain Norman Sickles and get
him off, and later go with him to Boston by rail.</p>

<p>He shook his head. He could hardly part his
swollen lips to talk; and then could only half
whisper. "I'll sail to-morrow on the <i>Sirius</i>," he
said; and rolled his head over to see what Sickles
was doing.</p>

<p>Sickles was just then stepping through that
kitchen doorway where but two minutes earlier
Rose had been standing. Drislane closed his
eyes; and then, as if he thought he had to show
me he wasn't beaten, he opened them and smiled.
After I'd fully taken in that smile, I wished he had
cried.</p>

<p>The bartender called through the slide that the
carriage was waiting. I carried out Drislane,
drove him to my hotel, and called in a doctor.
<span class='pagenum'>[152]</span>
Between us we gave him a hot bath, salved and
plastered him, and put him to bed.</p>

<p>I turned in on a cot which I had had brought
in. Hours after I heard him groan. I switched
on the light and went to him. He was lying on
his side with his head on one arm. His hands
were clinched.</p>

<p>After a moment he said: "She is in trouble
somewhere." That was another one of the things
he believed in&mdash;telepathy.</p>

<p>He may or may not have had it right; but it
certainly wasn't going to do him any good to let
him lie there and be torturing himself. "Sh-h&mdash;go
to sleep, son. Don't imagine things. You'll
find everything will be all right to-morrow," I
said.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "everything will never be all
right while he's alive and I'm alive."</p>

<p>That didn't sound good to me, so I sat down by
the bed and began to talk to him. We talked, I
doing the most of it, until past daylight. We
talked of her. "She's all right," he said at last,
"I tell you she is. Even if she didn't like me and
did him, it would be only natural. But she likes
me&mdash;the best of her likes me better than him, and
when she gets to know him all of her will like me.
You'll see."</p>

<p>There were people who used to say Drislane
<span class='pagenum'>[153]</span>
was so innocent as to be a joke; but after that
talk into that wintry dawn I had to salute him.
He had just a little something on all of us who
were so much more worldly-wise. It surely was a
great gift he had&mdash;to see in every woman only the
shining soul.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>No man could say where the word came from,
no man could say that he had seen her himself;
but the word was out that Oliver Sickles had
boarded his vessel in the early morning with the
red-haired girl of the Tidewater Caf&eacute; in tow.</p>

<p>Nobody on the <i>Sirius</i> ever intended to pass the
word to Drislane, but no crew of a vessel can be
whispering for hours without the one man they
don't discuss the mysterious matter with wanting
to guess what it is they are trying to keep
from him. Drislane guessed.</p>

<p>I had brought him to the <i>Sirius</i> in a carriage
just before she sailed. Captain Norman had
told him to keep to his bunk until the <i>Sirius</i> tied
up to the dock in Boston if he wished, but Drislane
did not wish. He came on deck, still bandaged
and battered, on the first morning out, to
stand his watch. A word blown across the deck,
when he was thought to be still in his bunk below,
<span class='pagenum'>[154]</span>
halted him in his walk aft. He turned and
stared at the man who was speaking, whereupon
followed such a sudden and foolish twist to the
conversation that he might just as well have been
told.</p>

<p>Throughout his trick at the wheel Drislane said
nothing, but every moment the compass could
spare his eyes saw them roaming across to where
the <i>Orion</i>, like ourselves, was plugging through the
short green seas for home. When his watch was
done he borrowed my glasses, climbed by painful
relays to the masthead and trained them on the
<i>Orion</i>. After he came down and had gone below,
I went aloft and spent the rest of the morning
trying to see what it was that Drislane may have
seen on the deck of Oliver Sickles's vessel.</p>

<p>Was it a woman's head showing above the
cabin companionway? or was it a man passenger
Oliver Sickles had taken aboard at the last minute?
If a man, he surely was no seagoer; for in
the two hours that I watched he never once stepped
out on deck. He leaned dejectedly, or it might be
patiently, but, either way, motionless as a stanchion
against the companion casing, his soft flapping
hat and the shoulders of a loose coat showing
just above the woodwork. Man or woman,
the face was pointed steadily toward the <i>Sirius</i>.</p>

<p>Our captain said it was a passenger of some kind.
<span class='pagenum'>[155]</span>
It had to be, he said, because during the morning
he had kept an eye on the <i>Orion's</i> deck and accounted
for every man of her crew, which numbered
exactly the same as his own; even for the
cook, who had shown himself on deck to heave a
bucket of galley refuse over the rail. It could
not be an extra hand shipped for the trip, because
no hand would be allowed to stand on the
cabin stairs.</p>

<p>And did he think it was a man or a woman?
The shoulders in the loose coat looked wide
enough to be a man's. And I looked at him and
he at me. So was Drislane's Rose big enough for
a man, but we said no more of that then&mdash;Drislane
had just come on deck and was making his
way aft. Again he borrowed my glasses, went
aloft, and trained them on the <i>Orion</i>. From time
to time he looked down to the man at the wheel,
as if to hint to him to get a little nearer the <i>Orion</i>,
but the man at the wheel had already got a quiet
word from the captain. We were to leeward.
"Keep off&mdash;keep off&mdash;off&mdash;off&mdash;!" Captain Norman
was saying in a low voice to the helmsman.
"Don't let her get any nearer, leastwise while he's
aloft with the glasses."</p>

<p>It looked as if we would have to wait to get
to Boston to settle the question. Meantime, if
Drislane would only try to forget everything of
<span class='pagenum'>[156]</span>
shore matters, he might be getting great comfort
of a run like this. If he were himself, he would
by now, being half in the way of a poet and half
hoping some day to be an artist, be drawing little
water-colors and writing little rhymes of these
two big schooners racing home together.</p>

<p>'Twould have been well worth his paint and
paper. The <i>Orion</i> and the <i>Sirius</i> were two of the
best in their class and more trimly modelled than
most. What the <i>Orion</i> looked like we must have
looked like, and she was something I used to
spend whole watches on deck just looking at.
She carried an open rail amidships, and her white-painted
stanchions, carved to hour-glass form,
with the white-painted flat hand-rail atop, stood
clearly, sharply, beautifully out above her black
lower sides and the pale-green seas.</p>

<p>Not that either of us had much lower planking
to show, for four thousand five hundred tons of
coal had brought us pretty well down to our
scuppers. Too deep-loaded for our best looks,
some would say; but I don't know&mdash;with all her
jibs and all whole sail to her five lower spars, we
must have looked pretty good, the pair of us,
plugging along together through the curling
rollers. We had set no topsails or staysails,
because they would not have stayed on, blowing
as it was a good half-gale.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[157]</span>
It could have been blowing twice a gale and nothing happened to either
of us. Probably no stiffer class of vessels sails the seas than the big
coasters of our side of the North Atlantic. Give them plenty of ballast
and there is no capsizing them. We surely had plenty of ballast in us
now, and took cheerfully all the hard westerly had to give us, and
foamed along. Foamed? We wallowed&mdash;like a couple of sailing submarines
almost. In that wind and sea, with all that loose water sloshing around
her deck, there was no careless standing around of course; but with
rubber boots to your hips, a good oil-slicker to your back, and yourself
lashed to something solid up to wind'ard, it was a great place for a man
to let the wind blow away three months of coal-dust from his eyelids;
and what the wind couldn't blow away the sea would surely wash out.</p>

<p>That loose water flopping around her deck&mdash;that
was no harm. "Tarpaulin her hatches, clamp 'em
down, and let her roll!"&mdash;that had been Captain
Norman's word coming out of Hampton Roads.
And "Batten her down and let her plug into it!"
had come roaring across to us at almost the same
moment from the deck of the <i>Orion</i>. And no
more than into the open Atlantic than we were
plugging into it. The sea came mounting up over
our low lee-rails&mdash;up, up our swash-swept decks,
<span class='pagenum'>[158]</span>
clear across us sometimes, when for a moment a
doubtful helmsman would let her ship an extra
cargo. But, again, no harm in that. Let 'em
slosh and let 'em roll&mdash;we were standing up, the
pair of us, like two brick houses. And the rest
didn't matter. And so almost forgetting Drislane's
trouble in the strain of the race, we batted our way
through the winter seas on which the sun was
dancing&mdash;batted and slatted, plugged and slugged
our way beside the <i>Orion</i> for the New England
coast.</p>

<p>Two vessels may be built alike and rigged
alike, but that doesn't mean they will sail alike.
The <i>Orion</i>, in the judgment of seafaring folk, was
a shade faster reaching and running than the
<i>Sirius</i>. At any rate, the <i>Orion</i> proved to us that
she was faster off the wind than we were by
rounding Cape Cod before us. To there it had
been a good passage. No collier loaded to her
scuppers is ever going to break any sailing records,
but hard driving had brought the pair of us along
at a good clip. So far, fine; but it was to be a
beat to windward for the rest of the way. West-north-west
is the course from Cape Cod to Boston,
and west-north-west was where the wind was
coming from when it hit us on the nose as we
rounded the Cape.</p>

<p>The <i>Orion</i> might outrun us, the <i>Sirius</i>, but to
<span class='pagenum'>[159]</span>
windward there was no difference except in their
masters; and there we had the best of it. Norman
Sickles could get more out of a vessel than
his cousin when the going was bad. Oliver used
to claw around deck like a sore-headed bear, and
every now and then go below and have a drink
for himself when things weren't breaking right.
Norman took things more quietly, and so taking
them wasn't too busy to grab every little chance
that bobbed up.</p>

<p>The <i>Orion</i> stood off on one tack, we on the
other, and by and by we lost her below the horizon;
but standing in, after some hours found her
again; and finding her, were pleased to see that
we had made up something on her. We filled
away once more, and by and by stood back to
her. We were making distance fast. Had we
held on we would have crossed her wake almost
under her stern on that tack. On our next tack
we would be crossing her bow, and it would then
be on past the lightship in the lead, and the race
over; for neither of us was going to tack up the
channel, deep-loaded, against a tide which would
soon be ebbing. Up at the harbor entrance two
tugs had already seen that and were racing out
to pick us up.</p>

<p>To more quickly get in tow of the tug nearest
us, which was coming hooked up for us, our captain
<span class='pagenum'>[160]</span>
put the <i>Sirius</i> about earlier than he had
originally intended. As we tacked, so did the
<i>Orion</i>. We stood in toward the harbor. The
<i>Orion</i> stood in toward the harbor. We were
surely going to pass close to each other&mdash;very
close. Altogether too close.</p>

<p>I didn't like the looks of things. Being a passenger,
I had a mind free for other things than
navigation. "In case of doubt who gives way&mdash;the
<i>Orion</i> or the <i>Sirius</i>?" I asked Captain Norman.
"Why, she does," he said, surprised. "It
has to be her&mdash;not us. Both of us close-hauled,
but we being starboard tack have the right of way.
He'll have to come about and give us the road."</p>

<p>"But suppose, captain, he will not give way?"</p>

<p>"What! not give way! That'd be foolish. He
c'n go bulling his way on shore all he pleases, but
out here he'll only get what's due him. He'll have
to give way."</p>

<p>So Norman Sickles said, but he wasn't the man
to lose his vessel or risk men's lives. The <i>Orion</i>
was holding on. She was going to force us. When
Norman Sickles saw that, he motioned with his
arm for the man at our wheel to keep off. But the
<i>Sirius</i> wasn't keeping off. Norman Sickles turned
and yelled: "Keep her off&mdash;off&mdash;off, I say!" starting
aft, at the same time, to take the wheel
himself.
<span class='pagenum'>[161]</span></p>

<p>He was too late. They seemed drawn together.
We took a shoot. The <i>Orion</i> took a
shoot. "Damned if she didn't get away from
him!" I remember hearing one of our fellows jerk
out, but I remember also I was left wondering
whether he meant our vessel or the <i>Orion</i>.</p>

<p>They rushed together and g-g-h-h! Talk of a
smash! Forty-five hundred tons of coal, nine-tenths
of it below the water-line, and a breeze of
wind! Either one would have sunk a battle-ship.
It shook the spars out of the <i>Orion</i>. Her after-mast
came down, the next one came down, the
others were swaying. "The boat&mdash;the boat!"
her crew yelled, but taking another look up at
those wabbling masts, they waited to launch no
boat. With few words but much action, they
went over her side, one after the other, and began
to claw out for the <i>Sirius</i>, on which&mdash;she was
sinking too&mdash;our crew had a big quarter-boat
ready to launch.</p>

<p>While the two vessels were still locked in collision
I had seen Drislane come running from aft
and leap into the <i>Orion</i>. I lost sight of him then,
because with our captain I had jumped below
into our cabin, he to save his ship's papers and I
to save my firm's. We were on deck in time to
get into our boat, and help pick up the crew of
the <i>Orion</i> in the water.
<span class='pagenum'>[162]</span></p>

<p>Looking for Drislane then, I saw him and Captain
Oliver Sickles at each other's throats in the
stern of the <i>Orion</i>. There wasn't much left of her
above water then. And on her deck it was a mess
of fallen spars, with her foremast the only stick
left, and that&mdash;unsupported by backstays and
the wind still pressing against the big sail&mdash;that
was wabbling. Even as we looked it came down&mdash;lower
and top parts&mdash;with a smash which
snapped the topmast off and sent it twisting and
gyrating to where, after a bound or two, it rolled
down and pinned to the deck the two battling
men in the stern. With it came a tangled mess
of halyards and stays.</p>

<p>We had picked up all of the <i>Orion's</i> crew from
the water and were now hurrying to get to the
two men on the <i>Orion</i>, which was fast settling,
when a red-haired girl came running from the
cabin companionway. Almost as if she had been
waiting in ambush, she rushed over to the fallen
spar, untangled the halyards from the legs of one
of the furthest men, and after an effort lifted the
end of the spar so that he could scramble free.
She needed to be strong to do that; but she was
strong. If she had held the spar up only an instant
longer, the other man might have wiggled
free too. But she let it drop back. The man she
had freed she picked up and carried to the quarter-rail,
<span class='pagenum'>[163]</span>
where she waited for us in the boat. He made
an effort as if to get back to the man left under
the spar, but she would not let him. "Tain't no
crime, Honey," I heard her say as we got to them.
She went overboard as she said it, and we had to
hurry to get her. "I know him a heap better than
you-all, Honey&mdash;let him rest where he done fall
to."</p>

<p>She couldn't swim, but we got them in time.
She didn't mind us in the least. "He done tol'
me, Honey, you was dyin' abo'd yo' ship 'n' o'
coase I goes on down to see. It sure did look like
yo' own ship, Honey"&mdash;she was saying to him
before we had them both fairly in the boat. It
was Drislane she had, his head cuddled on her
knees till the tug came and got us.</p>

<p>We weren't in time to get to the man she had
left behind. The last we saw of him was his head
sticking out like a turtle's from under the fallen
spar as the <i>Orion</i> went under.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We were all in Boston by Christmas Eve; that
is, all of course but Oliver Sickles&mdash;and nobody
gibed at his memory for that. He had his good
reason.</p>

<p>The tug rushed the two crews up the harbor
to our dock, where I left them while I went
to get carriages and warm clothes and so on.
<span class='pagenum'>[164]</span>
When I came back Drislane and his Rose were
gone and no word behind them. But the day after
Christmas he came to the office early to get his
semiannual check and cash it. I wasn't there,
but he left word for me that he and Rose were
married, and he was going to take my advice
and go home to his people. The office force said
that with him was a girl of glorious Titian hair
and super-physique, who smiled wonderfully on
him.</p>

<p>Captain Norman married the girl he should
have married in the first place. And so all the
good people came happy out of it; all except our
firm. Nine thousand tons at two dollars per ton&mdash;there
was eighteen thousand dollars' worth of
freights that we never collected.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>So there's the <i>Orion</i> and <i>Sirius</i> thing, only, in
telling it at the Sailor's Haven the other night,
our old stevedore didn't say anything of Rose's
part in it. He probably didn't see what that had
to do with it. However, he said enough to convince
the lecturer, who was a pretty fair-minded
kind, that perhaps he would have to reconstruct
his views about sailors' superstitions.</p>

<p>And perhaps there is something in it; but it's
a poor case won't stand hearing both sides of the
evidence. "Hoodoo ships!" It's a fascinating
phrase, but&mdash;Oliver Sickles it was who held the
wheel of the <i>Orion</i>, and it was Drislane to the
wheel of the <i>Sirius</i>, when they came together.</p>

<h2><a name="leary" id="leary"></a>LEARY OF THE "LIGONIER"</h2>


<p>It was a gloomy house, set in the shadow of a
rocky bluff, and made more gloomy within by
the close-drawn curtains. Since the news had
come of the loss of John Lowe's son, no man in all
Placentia Bay could say he had seen those curtains
raised; and, so ran the gossip, John Lowe
being what John Lowe was, a long time again
before those curtains would be raised.</p>

<p>John Lowe sat reading his black-typed, double-columned
page by the table, and over by the
stove John Lowe's second wife sat rocking herself.</p>

<p>John Lowe's daughter came in, removed her
shawl, and took a chair on the other side of the
stove. Her stepmother spoke a word; but no
word of greeting did her father offer until his
chapter was finished, and then he no more than
half turned, while his harsh voice asked: "Has
he come into the bay yet?"</p>

<p>"He has. Tim Lacy, that shipped wi' him
out o' here, was to Shepperd's to-day&mdash;and he'll
be to Shepperd's to-night, Tim says."
<span class='pagenum'>[170]</span></p>

<p>"Tim Lacy. Another o' his kin. And what
would be bringin' him to Shepperd's to-night?"</p>

<p>"It will be a dance to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, the dancin'! No fear but you'll know
o' the dancin'. An' he'll be there, the drinkin',
murderin'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's no' right, father, to be speakin' like that
o' a man you never set eyes on."</p>

<p>"An' how come it you know him, girl? Where
was it you had truck wi' him? Where?"</p>

<p>"I never had truck wi' him. But I see him.
Who could help seein' him&mdash;he was in an' out o'
Shepperd's his last time in."</p>

<p>"Well, take care you see him no more. An'&mdash;"
A step outside the door caused John Lowe to
pause.</p>

<p>"Ah-h&mdash;" John Lowe almost smiled.</p>

<p>His wife glanced at the clock. "It will be the
trader," she explained.</p>

<p>"Aye, an' now we'll ha' the news&mdash;now we'll
ha' the news."</p>

<p>A knock followed the step, and, following the
knock, the door opened and in stepped the expected
trader. No wild daredevil, no sail carrier
this, but a smooth, passionless man of business.
And he got right down to business.</p>

<p>"By dawn, John Lowe, there'll be two hundred
men of the bay drawn up on Half-Tide Beach.
<span class='pagenum'>[171]</span>
And an hour later the <i>Ligonier</i> and all's in her
will be lyin' on the bottom of the bay&mdash;or so"&mdash;he
glanced doubtfully at the girl&mdash;"or so we
planned it. Will you be there, John Lowe?"</p>

<p>"He'll no' be there, Mr. Lackford." Mrs. Lowe
half rose from her chair.</p>

<p>John Lowe glared at her. "And since when is
it for you to say I'll not be there?"</p>

<p>"I'm your lawful wife, John Lowe. And who
is this man would tell you what to do? You read
your Bible night and morn, John Lowe, and you
tell me and you tell Bess we should read it, too,
and all the bay knows it. An' how can you preach
to us as you do an' join in this deed? 'Righteous
shall be all my days,' say you, an' you think o'
joinin' a band that will sink an' destroy&mdash;yes, an'
mayhap kill in the morning. This American has
as much right to what herrin' his men can ketch
as anybody else."</p>

<p>John Lowe turned to the trader. "She's right,
Mr. Lackford, she's right."</p>

<p>"You'll not be with us?"</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"After all you said! Well, there will be enough
without you." He was still addressing John
Lowe, but it was on the woman his eyes were
bent. "Only let me carry back the word you'll
not be against us."
<span class='pagenum'>[172]</span></p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;I'll not be against you."</p>

<p>"That's enough. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>The door closed. They listened to the crunching
of the trader's boot-heels on the pebbly beach
outside.</p>

<p>"They'll be killing, mayhaps, in the morning,
and it's well for you to be clear of it, John Lowe."</p>

<p>"But he lost my son."</p>

<p>"It was a natural death for a fisherman, John
Lowe, to be lost that way."</p>

<p>"But what reason to love him for it?"</p>

<p>"What reason ha' ye to hate him till you know
more of him?"</p>

<p>Silence reigned again in the kitchen; silence
until John Lowe set aside his book and made for
the stairs. With his foot on the bottom step he
paused and sighed. "Even after three months
it's no' easy to bear. But you're right, wife, it's
no' right what some of them be up to."</p>

<p>"No, it's no' right. An' he's not the man
Lackford an' the others would ha' you believe,
John."</p>

<p>He looked long at his wife. "No? No doubt
no&mdash;but no stop to it now. If there was a way
to slip a word and not be known for it; but there's
no way. Come to bed, woman. But"&mdash;the girl
was standing up&mdash;"where be you off to?"
<span class='pagenum'>[173]</span></p>

<p>The girl looked to her stepmother; and the
stepmother answered for her.</p>

<p>"It's o'er-early for bed yet&mdash;she's goin' for an
hour to Shepperd's, John. Go on, Bess, but don't
stay too long."</p>

<p>The girl snatched her shawl and hurried out.</p>

<p>"And is't so you manage her, woman?"</p>

<p>"Let be, man, let be. She's no child to be
managed&mdash;your way o' managin'. Why shouldn't
she have her little pleasure? What's one here for?
Prayers an' psalms, prayers an' psalms&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' do you rail against the prayin'?"</p>

<p>"Not me. Prayin's for good, no doubt; but
all of us hasn't the sin so black that it needs
prayin' night an' day to burn it out."</p>

<p>He glared at her. "An' you're waitin' up for
her?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Some night you'll wait o'er-long, woman."</p>

<p>"No, no. She's young, is Bess, and a bit soft.
But no bad&mdash;no, no, no bad in Bess. She's all
we ha' left now, John&mdash;lay a light hand to her."</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Up to old man Shepperd's the dance was on,
and Bess Lowe was there; and not long before
the American captain blew through the door;
<span class='pagenum'>[174]</span>
and no dreary passage of time before he spied
Bess.</p>

<p>"Why, Bess, God bless you, how are you?
And you ain't forgot? And do I get a dance this
evenin' or no? Tell me, do I, now? Ay, that's
you&mdash;hard-hearted as ever. Eyes to light a vessel
to port, but never a soft look in 'em."</p>

<p>"My eyes, Captain Leary?"</p>

<p>"Ay, your eyes, Bess. Eyes, Bess, that the
likes of never looked across the bay before&mdash;eyes
that flash out from the dark like twin shore-lights
when a man's been weeks to sea."</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain Leary!" breathed Bess; and
presently took to sighing, and from sighing to
smiling, and all at once burst out into such laughter
that the whole company took notice; whereat
a huge, surly man in a corner went into the back
room.</p>

<p>"Gi' me one drink and I'll smash him into bits,"
the big man said to Lackford, the trader, who was
standing guard in the back room over the little
jug which Shepperd kept handy for his guests.</p>

<p>"What, now? No. Not now, please, not now.
There'll be plenty of chances for fighting in the
morning. The crowd is only waiting for daylight
to make a move. They want you. Come on
now, do, and get a good night's sleep so's to be
feeling good in the morning. Come on now. And
<span class='pagenum'>[175]</span>
you'll have two hundred men at your back in
the morning, remember; and remember, too, that
after you've put the American out of the way all
the girls in the bay'll fall to your hand."</p>

<p>The big man was diverted, and passed out
with Lackford, meantime that Leary, with an
arm half around the girl's waist, was pleading:
"The next dance for me, hah, Bess?"</p>

<p>"Ay, captain&mdash;who could deny you?" and they
went at it.</p>

<p>'Twas a shuffling across the floor, a whirling of
buxom partners by husky men, who never omitted
to mark the measure with the thump of boot-heels
that jumped the dust from cellar to roof.
Shouting, stamping, joking, smiling, with quick
breathing&mdash;such joy entirely it was, with Tim
Lacy, oilskinned and jack-booted, leading the
swing across the floor. Yes, and back again, although
on him, even as on Leary, old Shepperd
looked with disapproving eye.</p>

<p>"A wonder, Tim Lacy, you wouldn't leave
your gear on your vessel," he snorted.</p>

<p>"Sure, an' I'm on my way to the vessel now,
an' she'll be leavin' the bay for the States in the
mornin'."</p>

<p>"You think she will," amended Shepperd, from
behind the musician, who was his own strong-lunged
daughter Sue.</p>

<p>On a chair atop of a fish-box in one corner was
<span class='pagenum'>[176]</span>
balanced Sue, a native genius, who puffed most industriously
into a musical instrument made of a
sheet of tissue-paper wrapped around a fine-tooth
comb.</p>

<p>Tim Lacy, though he never let on, caught the
sly remark. Less guileless than he looked was
Lacy, a little man, forever lighting his pipe. He
struck another match now, and between puffs delivered
a belated message. So many years senior
was Lacy to his skipper that he used to talk to
him like a father.</p>

<p>"You know, as you said yourself, we was to
hurry, Sammie&mdash;and do come now, Sammie"&mdash;<i>puff</i>&mdash;"and
hurry on"&mdash;<i>puff</i>&mdash;"to Half-Tide
Beach"&mdash;<i>puff</i>&mdash;"and there we'll take the dory for
the vessel. Ah-h, there she's goin'. No, drat her,
she's out again! Hurry on, boy. We oughtn't
be standin' here all night. The crew'll be waitin'
for us wi' the vessel at Caplin Cove. A
special word they left for you, Sammie. They
says if you was here"&mdash;here Tim stepped close
and whispered&mdash;"as how I was to tell you they're
feared for trouble."</p>

<p>He peered over the flame of the last-lit match
at his skipper.</p>

<p>"'Tell him, Tim,' they says to me, 'that if
we're to get the last o' the herrin' aboard that
they're afeard it'll have to be an early start.' I
misdoubt"&mdash;<i>puff</i>&mdash;"they have a notion of how
<span class='pagenum'>[177]</span>
there was goin' to be trouble. So come on; do,
boy."</p>

<p>"One more, Tim; one more dance before we
break up. A crime to go out on a cold night like
this and not have a farewell dance. Come on,
Bess; what d'y' say? There's the girl!"</p>

<p>Tim was gone, but back and forth Sam and
Bess sidled and stamped, and many another minute
passed with Sam still whirling his able-bodied
partner, pacing her across and back again, lifting
her off her feet, and swinging her&mdash;one, two,
three full circles off the floor. And Sam was the
boy could do it, a hundred and seventy pounds
though she weighed, and continued to whirl her
after the last dance till they were out of the room
and into the shadows of the porch, where he
snatched her up and kissed her fair.</p>

<p>The girl's heart leaped out to him. Did ever
such a man make landing in the bay before? And
surely he must think the world of her? Tenderness
for him overwhelmed her; and out under the
stars she whispered the words of warning in his ear.</p>

<p>"What's it, Bess? You're not foolin'? The
trader to the head of them?"</p>

<p>"Ay, an' they'll be at Half-Tide Beach afore
the sun rises&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"D'y' mean, Bessie, d'y' mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean all that's bad they'll do to you,
Sammie. I heard 'em my own self. 'What right
<span class='pagenum'>[178]</span>
has this American to come here and take the
herrin' from our very doors? What right?' That's
the way the trader talked to 'em in the back room
afore you came in. 'In the old days I've seen
men beat to death on the beach for less,' I heard
'em through the bulkhead. 'Ay, an' their vessels
run up on the rocks somewhere,' he goes on.
An' it's you, Sammie, they has in mind."</p>

<p>"And the crew to Caplin Cove, an' only me and
Tim to stand by the vessel. The vessel and her
full hold. But who'll get the word to them? If
only there was some one, some one we could
trust, Bess!"</p>

<p>"There is one that could do that, too, boy."</p>

<p>"Who? What! Yourself, Bess? Could you
make where they are&mdash;Caplin Cove&mdash;alone, and by
night&mdash;and tell 'em what's in the wind, so they'll
be aboard in time, while I go and hurry after Tim
Lacy to the vessel at Half-Tide Harbor? Could
a woman like a man well enough to do that?"</p>

<p>"Well, women likes men sometimes, Sammie."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Bess, of course. And sometimes,
too, a man likes&mdash;But, Bess!" She
lay swaying in the hollow of his arm. "Bessie!"&mdash;and
oh, the nearness of him! "I don't want to
fool you, girl&mdash;we <i>was</i> carryin' sail the night
your brother Simon was lost. A livin' gale, and
she buttin' into it with a whole mains'l&mdash;you
won't hold that agin' me?"
<span class='pagenum'>[179]</span></p>

<p>"How could I, Sammie? A man that's a man
at all is bound to carry sail at times. And fishermen,
sail-carryin' or no sail-carryin', they comes
and goes."</p>

<p>"Ay, girl, and sometimes goes quicker than
they comes. Oh, Bess, the fine men I've been
shipmates with! And now 'twould take a chart
of all the banks 'tween Hatteras and Greenland to
find out where the bones of the half of 'em lie."</p>

<p>"But do go now, Sammie." She snuggled
closer to him. "Have a care now, for I'm lovin'
you now, Sammie."</p>

<p>"Ay, you are. And I'm lovin' you, Bess. But
your father, Bess; he'll put you out."</p>

<p>"Well, if he do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he do, Bess, you know who'll be waitin' for
you."</p>

<p>"Ay, I do. An' I'll come to you, too, no fear,
boy. But no matter about John Lowe now, boy,
so you won't forget me, Sammie."</p>

<p>"Never a forget, Bessie."</p>

<p>"Then hold me again, Sammie, afore we part.
And don't forget&mdash;never a man afore did I like
like I likes you, Sammie."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And Bess had gone and delivered her message
to Leary's crew at Caplin Cove. "Be all hands
aboard afore dawn and have her ready to sail," was
<span class='pagenum'>[180]</span>
Bessie's message, and with that put off for home
in her father's little sloop. There had been stars
on her run over, bright, cheerful stars that made
you overlook the frost in the air, but no stars now.
But that was the way of the weather in the bay.</p>

<p>In the lee of Shingle Spit it was calm enough,
and so, for all the boom of the sea outside, Bess
had time for revery. A gran' figur' of a man,
Sammie Leary. Strong he was. Ay, strong.
An' not stern. Lord knows, there was enough of
that to home. No, no, saft-like same as Sammie&mdash;that
was the kind for a woman to love.</p>

<p>And Sammie now. Out under the shadow of
the porch he had said: "You're the lass for me."
Ay, he did. But so many talked like that and
meant naught by it, but took your kiss and your
heart wi' the kiss and sailed away, and you never
again see 'em, mayhap. There was Jessie Mann,
and&mdash;Oh, no matter them. Sammie was none
o' their kind o' men. An' yet&mdash;there were those
who said that one like Sammie never made a
good husband. Sailed wi' too free a sheet, he
did. An' yet, did ever a vessel get anywhere without
a free sheet at times?</p>

<p>And, thinking of a free sheet, Bess gave the
little sloop a foot or two more of main-sheet. And
there she was going through the water faster for
it. And she would need to go fast through the
<span class='pagenum'>[181]</span>
water if so be she was to get home this night.
And if she didn't get home&mdash;but 'twas o'er-early
to worry about what her father would say.</p>

<p>But was it all so true about a free sheet? Was
it no' true that, holdin' a vessel's nose to the wind,
she'd sail her course wi' never a foot o' leeway?
'Twas so her father maintained. Always safest
to be on the straight course, her father held.
True enough, but wi' the wind ahead, what headway?
None at all&mdash;while, if you let them run off
a bit, when they did come back on the course they
was farther on the road, arter all. Ay, so it was.
And Sammie? What did the poor boy ever know
of a home or a lovin' heart to guide him! Oh,
ay, women should make allowances for men like
Sammie. 'Twas the good heart in him.</p>

<p>Out beyond the end of the spit the little boat
began to feel the pressure of the wind and the
thump of the sea. She jumped so because there
wasn't much ballast in her. An' there was the
matter o' ballast now. A gran' thing in a vessel,
a bit o' ballast&mdash;like religion in a body. Not all
religion, like her father, for then 'twas like a
vessel loaded down wi' ballast&mdash;took a gale o'
wind to stir her, and a vessel o' that kind was no
mortal use whatever&mdash;except mayhap for a lightship
or something o' that kind.</p>

<p>The sea by now was coming inboard regularly,
<span class='pagenum'>[182]</span>
and Bess knew she should be carrying less sail;
but it would mean a lot of time to reef the mainsail,
and if she was to get on there was small time
for reefing, 'specially as the wind was hauling to
the east. A beat home now, as Captain Leary
warned her, 'twould be. Surely she would never
be home by daylight now. And colder now it was.
Ay, it was. She drew the tarpaulin over her
knees, and that helped to keep off the spray
which, as it splashed up from her bows, was
carried aft in sheets before every squall.</p>

<p>And those squalls were frequent. And little
pellets of hail were thickening the air. And over
the tarpaulin that covered her the ice was making.
Sailin' by the wind, 'tis terrible cold. She
was becoming drowsy&mdash;hard work to keep from
falling asleep. Good enough for her&mdash;ay, good
enough, her father would say&mdash;dancin' half the
night and carryin' messages to strangers the other
half.</p>

<p>The air softened and that was some relief; but
in place of the awful cold&mdash;and still cold enough&mdash;was
now the snow. And in that snow-storm, with
the wind continually veering, she knew at last she
must have run off her course; for the sound of the
surf beating against the rocks came to her.</p>

<p>And what would that be? What now? Ay,
Shark's Fin Ledge it must be. She must ha'
<span class='pagenum'>[183]</span>
sailed wi' too free a sheet, arter all. Ay, she
must ha'. Time to come about now. But not
so much sail on! Well, sail or no sail, it was time
to come about. About she was comin'&mdash;ay&mdash;she
was&mdash;no!&mdash;ay&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Over came the boom, and then high it skied,
and then the wind took it and slit the sail from
boom to gaff and off to leeward went the sloop.</p>

<p>Too much sheet that time, thought poor Bess,
and could have cried at herself. And might have
cried if she had nothing else to do. But no time
now. Her little sloop was rolling and pitching in
the seas, and drifting, always drifting; and in that
snow there was no seeing how fast she was drifting
in to the ledge; but fast enough, no doubt.</p>

<p>No use wailing over it. Bess took to bailing,
and the work kept her from thinking overmuch
of herself; only she couldn't help picturing her
father with his Bible, and her stepmother waiting
up for her. And Sammie? Never another
dance or kiss from Sammie. And oh, the black
disgrace of it if she was lost in the bay, when maybe
they found her body ground to pieces on the
ledge! There would be those who would say&mdash;what
wouldn't they say&mdash;of her that couldn't hide
her likin' for him up to the dance at Shepperd's?
<span class='pagenum'>[184]</span></p>



<h3>III</h3>

<p>The tail of the night found Leary striding over
the hills. "Going to heave her herrin' overboard,
are they? And she'll never clear for home,
hah? She won't, eh?" And over the hills he ran.
In and out, up and down, over the crests, and at
last down the tangled slope across moss-grown
rocks where lay the tide-tossed kelp, and onto the
beach, where in the dawn he came suddenly on
them.</p>

<p>A great shout went up when they were certain
'twas he; and down upon him presently they bore.</p>

<p>"Two hundred of 'em, maybe," calculated
Leary, and looked wistfully toward where his
vessel should have been laying to anchor. "If I
weren't such a hand for skylarkin' she'd be lay-in'
there now with Tim Lacy standin' by the old
six-pounder, and she loaded to the muzzle with
nails and one thing and another, ready to sweep
the beach of 'em." And somewhat sadly he waited
for the mob; and, waiting, wondered how Bess
was making out, for the squalls were chasing each
other off the hills, and out beyond the little harbor,
all whitecapped, lay the open bay.</p>

<p>As a sea sweeps up and buries the lone rock
under its surge, so did it seem to Leary that the
<span class='pagenum'>[185]</span>
mob must overwhelm him as he stood there alone
on the beach. Annihilation! Their gestures
and imprecations, as they drew near, implied
nothing less. "Well, let it come!" and from his
mind flew all but one clear idea. He would deal
them all the damage he could before they overbore
him; and if under their heels on the sand they
strove to crush the life out of him, he would reach
up and grasp as many as his arms would circle.</p>

<p>And then he heard the hail from behind him.
He flashed a look. Yes, there was the vessel,
and it was Tim Lacy calling. She was coming
into the wind. Her jibs were down by the run.
Ay, and there was the rattling of her chain-anchor.</p>

<p>"Skipper, oh, skipper," came the hail again,
and he heard the hoisting of a dory. To one hand
was the mob which meant his destruction; to
the other hand by the open water to the vessel if
he could make it. He had farther to go than they,
but they were mostly in oilskins, and he was a
rarely active man. That he knew. Away he
went over the little bowlders.</p>

<p>Diagonally he had to go. A straight parallel
to the beach it was for them. Fast as he was,
some of them would intercept his way to the
incoming dory. Three, four, perhaps a dozen
would be there before him.
<span class='pagenum'>[186]</span></p>

<p>A dozen it was, and one huge man and Lackford,
with no oilskins to hamper them, were in the
front; and because they were in front they felt
the force of Leary's arm. It would have been joy
to stop and battle with them all, but that wasn't
saving the vessel. He caught one with one hand,
and one with the other&mdash;and it was so easy and
so satisfying!</p>

<p>But that wouldn't be making Bess happy by
and by. There were two more that he could have
reached, but those two he dodged. But two now
between him, and he was for stopping to box
with them&mdash;the battle fever was getting him&mdash;but
a voice came to him: "Don't stop for them,
skipper. Come on. We're here."</p>

<p>Leary turned and saw, and raced for the water's
edge. A wide leap and he was in the dory. They
tore after him, minding not the fallen bodies in
their eagerness. Up to their waists in the water
they rushed with yells of rage. Stones came flying
after him. A few struck him, but they were
too small to do damage.</p>

<p>"Blast 'em, Sammie, don't talk to them. Out
oars, Ned, and drive her! Here's the kind of
talk for the likes of them!" and between his skipper's
<span class='pagenum'>[187]</span>
arm and body Tim Lacy from behind thrust
an old-fashioned heavy dragoon pistol. "Only
one shot in her, but make that one good; here
y'are, Sammie."</p>

<p>Leary's fingers curled about the stock of it,
and it felt pleasant to the touch. Yet for all that
he thrust it back, but as he did so Tim's dory-mate
tumbled down beside Leary in the dory.
On the bottom of the dory the jagged rock was
rolling even as the blood welled from his temple.
And then came a report&mdash;another, and a third;
and with the third a bullet whizzed close.</p>

<p>"Blast you all!" shrieked Leary, and with a
leg either side of the fallen man's body he held
the pistol waist-high. "Come on now! Come on
now, I say! <i>You</i>, and <i>you</i>, and <i>you</i>,
you white-livered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After him&mdash;drag him out of the dory!"</p>

<p>"Ay, drag me out! Come you and drag me
out!" And threatening variously with his pistol,
Leary pointed directly at what seemed to be a new
leader, a man with a revolver. "And let me tell
you"&mdash;he pointed to the armed man&mdash;"whoever
you are, you round-shouldered, glue-eyed squid
you, whoever goes, you go first. Mind that&mdash;whatever
happens, <i>you</i> go first. I've got <i>you</i>, you
pop-eyed, slit-mouthed dogfish&mdash;and now shoot
again."
<span class='pagenum'>[188]</span></p>

<p>The man with the revolver shrank back; but
Leary's pistol was still trained on him, and farther
and farther he shrank until he melted into
the body of the crowd.</p>

<p>In the rear of the crowd were those who struggled
to get nearer. "Why don't you go after him
down there?" they yelled. "Or let us do it? One
man against you all! Why don't you pull him
out of the dory?"</p>

<p>"Ay, pull him out! Send him to hell!" roared
another.</p>

<p>"Well, send me to hell," retorted Leary&mdash;"maybe
I've got friends in hell, too!"</p>

<p>Back onto the beach receded the mob. Leary
turned to his mate. "To the vessel, Tim&mdash;and
drive her!"</p>

<p>By the time they reached the vessel's deck the
injured man came to. A cup of coffee and five
minutes by the fire and he was ready to turn
to, but Leary turned him into a bunk instead.
"We've men enough without you&mdash;a full crew.
Lie down, boy, and go to sleep." Which he did.</p>

<p>"Now, fellows, make sail. Drive her. The
trader an' that whole crowd, they'll be after us
soon in their jacks. Come on&mdash;lively&mdash;there's
thirty sail of 'em ready to round the point! An',
Tim?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Sammie."
<span class='pagenum'>[189]</span></p>

<p>"Get out that old salutin' six-pounder and
lash it for'ard o' the windlass. Lash her hard so
she won't kick overboard when she's fired."</p>

<p>"Ay, Sammie," and Lacy hurried off.</p>

<p>"And now, up with the jibs. And then mains'l&mdash;we've
lost a lot of time already. With her four
lowers and those squalls shootin' off the high hills
from the other side of the bay, she'll soon have
wind enough. And we've got to be out of here
before the snow sets in. A bad place here in
thick weather. Drive her, fellows&mdash;drive her!"</p>

<p>They were swaying up the mainsail when Leary
happened to look over his shoulder. With the
wind of the frequently recurring squalls taking
hold of the great sail, they had a hard task to get
it up; but at last it was set; and then they
trimmed in the main-sheet, while Leary ran forward
to the howitzer.</p>

<p>"What you got to load it with, Tim?"</p>

<p>"There's black powder enough, Sammie."</p>

<p>"But we want to do something more than
salute 'em, Tim."</p>

<p>"M-m&mdash;there's the soundin' leads, Sammie."</p>

<p>"Get 'em!" And Tim went and came back
with a deep-sea lead which he rammed in after a
hatful or so of powder.</p>

<p>When all was ready four inches of the lead
stuck out of the muzzle.
<span class='pagenum'>[190]</span></p>

<p>"No matter; you'll do," Leary commented, and
cast another look toward the open water of the
bay where were now twenty-five or thirty small
schooners rounding the headland.</p>

<p>Leary now contemplated the anchor chain of
his vessel.</p>

<p>"I hate to lose you, 'specially like this, but&mdash;" And
without further word he reduced the chain
to one turn of the windlass. "And now let all
hands tuck away under the rail, all but one man
to go aloft and look out for a small white sloop."
And he took the wheel, where he was needed,
for the squalls, in full force, were now whistling
battle-hymns from deck to truck.</p>

<p>The fleet of jacks were now to be seen coming
on rapidly; but presently, the squall proving too
strong for them, they all came fluttering up into
the wind and began to shorten sail.</p>

<p>"No heaving-to for this one, eh, Tim?" yelled
Leary; and putting his wheel up, and feeling the
<i>Ligonier</i> beginning to pay off and the anchor to
drag, he gave the word to slip the cable.</p>

<p>Through the hawse-hole the clanking chain tore
swiftly, and away came the <i>Ligonier</i> like a wild
thing. Leary patted the wheel and began to talk
to her:</p>

<p>"Crazy to get away, aren't you? Been laying
too long to anchor, yes. No wonder. And I'll
<span class='pagenum'>[191]</span>
not stint you now&mdash;take your fill of it, girl."
Which she did, and with Leary giving her plenty
of wheel, through the white swash she scooped a
long, wet rail.</p>

<p>Tim Lacy now came aft. "There they are
waitin' for us&mdash;an' the joke of it is, Sammie, we
c'n go out the North Passage with a fair wind.
They must 'a' forgot that I was born and brought
up in this very bay."</p>

<p>"But we're not goin' out the North Passage,
Tim."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But why? An' it's a beat up by them."</p>

<p>"Well, a beat it'll be. Go for'ard now."</p>

<p>"What'll he be at now?" muttered Tim.</p>

<p>But Leary knew. One eye he had for the approaching
fleet and one to the ledge of rocks
toward which the <i>Ligonier</i> was winging. "Some
of 'em, by this time, think we're trying to run
away. But they'll know better in a minute. And
now do you, Tim, stand by that old cannon."</p>

<p>She was almost into the rocks then, holding
in for the last foot of clear water; but not for too
long did he allow her to run on. Just in time
he tacked, and then it was about and away, for
the fleet of native schooners, who, watching her
closely and assured now of her course, spread out
<span class='pagenum'>[192]</span>
to intercept her. Expert seamen themselves, nowhere
did they leave a space wide enough for a
rowboat, let alone a ninety-ton fisherman, to slip
through.</p>

<p>And they were armed. A shot rang out.
Leary looked to see where the ball struck, but
among the endless merging of whitecaps there
was no discovering that. "Not that I care where
it hit, blast ye&mdash;ye'll never stop me now&mdash;for&mdash;hide
under the rail you, Tim, with the rest&mdash;I'm
after some of you." And he headed the <i>Ligonier</i>
straight for the windward jack, which now he
could see was that of the trader Lackford, whose
round-shouldered figure in the bow betrayed
him.</p>

<p>"Out of my way!" roared Leary before he
realized that he was too far away to be heard
against the whistling squall. "But you'll hear
me well enough soon," he muttered. "And, Tim,
so long as you won't hide away, stand by that old
fog-buster, and be sure to have the lanyard long
enough to let you hide behind the forem'st, for
there's no telling&mdash;the old antiquity might explode.
I don't s'pose she's been shot off this ten
years. When I give the word, now&mdash;but wait,
wait yet!" For a flying moment he brought the
<i>Ligonier's</i> head into the wind. "Now!"</p>

<p>Boom! It made more noise than a modern
<span class='pagenum'>[193]</span>
six-inch. They could see the long lead go skipping
under the bow of the trader's jack.</p>

<p>"Heave to!" roared Leary, "or the next one
goes aboard." No question but they could hear
him now. "Heave her to, I say! Ay, that's
right. Load the old lady again, Tim. And now"&mdash;his
voice rose high again&mdash;"you'd better all
heave to, and stand aside, for this one's bound
out, and 'll come blessed handy to cuttin' in
two whatever gets in her way."</p>

<p>And they luffed, twenty-odd sail of them, with
six to eight men aboard each, and stood to attention
while the <i>Ligonier</i>, with her crew's inquisitive,
grinning faces poked above her rail, came tearing
up and by.</p>

<p>"And now let be your batteries, Tim, and run
the ensign to the peak." Which was done; and
passed on in glory did the <i>Ligonier</i>, the old six-pounder
adorning one rail, a swish of white foam
burying the other, the colors aloft, and Sam Leary
singing war-songs to the wheel. And perfectly
happy would he have been only the snow was
thickening and no Bess in sight. But maybe she
had got safely home. Maybe. And just then
came from aloft:</p>

<p>"There's a little white sloop&mdash;an' some one in
it&mdash;at Shark's Fin Ledge a'most."</p>

<p>"Break out that gaff tops'l, fellows&mdash;and you,
<span class='pagenum'>[194]</span>
Tim, go aloft and point the way&mdash;and hurry, afore
the snow comes."</p>

<p>"Point the way to what, Sammie?"</p>

<p>"For a little white sloop with a girl in it."</p>

<p>"Ho-oh&mdash;that's it, is it?"</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Bess had curled herself up and was falling
asleep; and her last sleep it would have been but
for the boom of a small gun and the hail of a
familiar voice. She stood up. Again a hail.
And through the curtain of white it came almost
atop of her, the grandest schooner ever was! The
long lines of her seemed familiar. Then a clearer
glimpse. Ay, she'd know her anywhere&mdash;by the
rust on her jumbo she would&mdash;the <i>Ligonier</i>. And
then it swept on by&mdash;ay, sailing as a wild gull.</p>

<p>Out of sight it went in the snow-squall, but
leaving a voice in its trail.</p>

<p>"Bessie! Bessie!" it called.</p>

<p>And now no schooner at all. Gone it was.
And she remembered that that was the way of it&mdash;the
beautiful picture afore they went at last.
But soon again the sweep of the great white sails
and the black body beneath. And the beautiful
handling of her! "Seamen, them!" said Bess admiringly,
<span class='pagenum'>[195]</span>
and then alongside it came&mdash;beautiful,
beautiful.</p>

<p>Then two arms scooped down and swept her
over the rail of the lovely big American schooner.
A strong arm and a voice. "Oh, Bessie! Bessie!
and the big, warm, foolish heart of you!" said the
voice, and the arms carried her below and wrapped
her in blankets and poured hot coffee, mugs of it,
down her throat, and laid her in a bunk, while he
sat on the locker and looked&mdash;just looked at her.</p>

<p>"Ah-h, Sammie!" murmured Bess blissfully.
"An' now you'll bring me home, Sammie?"</p>

<p>"Ay, home, Bess."</p>

<p>"Ah-h! An' my mother'll no ha' to cry for
me, arter all. An' father, too, he'll ha' no cause
to&mdash;Ah-h, God love you, Sammie."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>By the light of the kerosene lamp in John Lowe's
kitchen sat John Lowe reading his favorite volume,
harrowing tales of religious persecution centuries
agone. And Mrs. Lowe sat rocking herself
by the stove. Every once in a while she would
hide her head in her skirt, and, on withdrawing
it, wipe her eyes.</p>

<p>Now and again she would sigh wearily. "Too
harsh, too harsh we were on the lass. The blood
runs warm at her age."</p>

<p>Whereat John Lowe would turn and look fixedly
<span class='pagenum'>[196]</span>
at her, open his lips as if to say something
but, always without speaking, refix his attention
on the fine black print before him.</p>

<p>A knock on the door and a tall man in oilskins
and sea-boots entered. "I've come to say&mdash;"
he began: but by then John Lowe was on his
feet.</p>

<p>"Captain Leary is it?"</p>

<p>"Captain Leary it is."</p>

<p>"Then, I've this to say to you, Captain
Leary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, John. Captain"&mdash;beside her husband
Mrs. Lowe stood trembling&mdash;"Captain Leary,
we've a little girl&mdash;an' the story's around the
bay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Leary raised a hand. "I know, ma'am; I
know. Your daughter, Mrs. Lowe, she's safe.
Yes, John Lowe, safe&mdash;in every way safe. No
thanks to me, but to herself. And she and me,
we're going to be married. Yes, ma'am, married.
Don't look so hard, man. You're thinkin' now,
I know&mdash;you're thinkin' it's a poor pilot I'll be
for her on life's course?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I'm thinkin' so, captain, and not afeard
to say it&mdash;I fear no man. Ay, a poor compass."</p>

<p>"Compass? There&mdash;a fine word, compass. But
the compass itself that 'most every one thinks is
so true, John Lowe, we have to make allowances
<span class='pagenum'>[197]</span>
for it, don't we? And after we've made the allowances,
it's as though it never pointed anywhere
but true north, isn't it? There's only one circle
on the ocean, John Lowe, where a compass don't
veer, but every ship can't be always on that line.
And even when you're sailin' that one circle, John
Lowe, there's sometimes deviations. And me&mdash;no
doubt I have my little variations and deviations."</p>

<p>"Ay, no doubt o' that," muttered John Lowe.</p>

<p>"Ay, like everything and everybody else, John
Lowe. But at last I've got to where I think I
know what little allowances to make. I think so.
And after we've made our little allowances, and
we c'n make 'em in advance same's if we took it
from a chart, why&mdash;there's Sammie Leary as true
as the next one."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lowe laid her hand on the American's
arm. "And Bess, captain; where is she?"</p>

<p>"Outside, Mrs. Lowe, with Tim. And she's
waiting."</p>

<p>"Waiting for what?"</p>

<p>"To be asked inside. Will I call her?"</p>

<p>"Call her, captain&mdash;call her."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Lowe, but&mdash;" Leary faced the
man at the table.</p>

<p>"Oh, well"&mdash;John Lowe sighed. "No doubt
you ha' the right o' it, captain. You're one who
ha' sailed many courses, an' your navigation, 'tis
<span class='pagenum'>[198]</span>
possible, is better than mine. Call her, captain,
call her."</p>

<p>Next morning, for all the bay to see, the curtains
in John Lowe's house were raised high.</p>

<h2><a name="hattie" id="hattie"></a>HOW THEY GOT THE "HATTIE RENNISH"</h2>


<p>On the word being passed that Alec Corning
was back from the West Coast, a few reminiscent
friends went to hunt him up, and found
him in the Anchorage, in a back room overlooking
Duncan's wharf; and Alec was agreeable, over a
social glass and a good cigar, to explain how it
came he was back in Gloucester.</p>

<p>"If they'd only let us alone I'd 'a' got&mdash;and
Archie Gillis too&mdash;good and rich."</p>

<p>"Rich, Alec? You rich?"</p>

<p>"Well, maybe not quite rich, for that, o' course,
would call for saving, but certainly I'd had a roll
to spend before I was done&mdash;if only they'd let
us alone. But would they? Man, the meddlers
they were!&mdash;the brass-buttoned, steam-winched
buttinskis!"</p>

<p>"But if that is their business, Alec?"</p>

<p>"M-m&mdash;maybe. But Russians, English, Japs&mdash;yes,
an' American cutters and gunboats before
they were done&mdash;you ought to seen them!"
<span class='pagenum'>[202]</span></p>

<p>Alec paused, but only for a quick breath. "We
had the finest little scheme of sealing till they took
to hunting us. Up and down the length and
breadth of the sealing-grounds they'd up and
chase us whenever they'd get word of us&mdash;from
the Japan coast back by way of the Aleutians&mdash;clear
down, one time, a pair of 'em, till we had
to put in behind Vancouver Island and hide the
<i>Hattie</i> behind a lot o' screen boughs."</p>

<p>Alec paused; this time for a longer, an almost
reflective, breath. "That being their business,
p'r'aps they were all right; but ain't it a fine
thing when a gang wants to go seal-hunting that
a lot o' gover'ment people must specify where
they can kill 'em, and when?&mdash;and they swimmin'
the wide ocean as the Lord intended! And our
little vessel&mdash;the <i>Hattie Rennish</i> when she used
to go fresh halibutin' out o' here&mdash;remember
her?"</p>

<p>There were several who heartily remembered
the fast and able <i>Hattie</i>.</p>

<p>Presently, letting the elevated front legs of his
chair drop to the floor, Alec rested one forearm
on the table and went on to tell of how at last
they got the <i>Hattie Rennish</i>.</p>

<p>"'Twas a Californian man named Trumbull
bought the <i>Hattie</i> when she was fresh halibutin'
out o' Gloucester. A good sort of a man, and
<span class='pagenum'>[203]</span>
'twas him got me, with Archie Gillis for mate, to
bring her 'round to Frisco.</p>

<p>"But the time I'm going to speak of, the <i>Hattie</i>&mdash;painted
green she was, and called the <i>Pioneer</i>&mdash;was
layin' into Seattle, when a chap comes
aboard with a letter from Trumbull to me explaining
that certain aspects of the sealing business
'd been taking on a serious look to him lately
and he'd sold the <i>Hattie</i>, and the party who'd
bought her, letter herewith, might want to do
business with me.</p>

<p>"The looks of the new owner didn't warm me
toward him in the start-off. Looks, of course,
ain't everything, but when you don't know much
about a man you got to go a lot by his looks.
Yes, you sure have. And I'd seen him before,
joy cruisin' on the Barbary Coast one night with
a lot of drunken sailors&mdash;only he wasn't drunk.
And I knew what he was&mdash;some Chinese blood
in him, and the name o' being a slick one. But
I didn't say anything about that. Gratu'tously
telling a man you don't like him don't lay you up
to wind'ard any. No. And we sat down and
he explains what he wanted. There was a consignment
of a few bales of hemp waiting up on
the British Columbia coast, and would I run the
<i>Hattie</i> over and slip back with 'em? And we'd
have to leave right away.
<span class='pagenum'>[204]</span></p>

<p>"Well, I would&mdash;after a talk. And with Archie
Gillis and a few hoboes that called themselves
sailors, which I'd picked up in Jack Downing's
place in Seattle, we put out. Archie was mate
and to get two hundred dollars and me five
hundred.</p>

<p>"It was a fine night, that night, and we put
out into the sound and worked our way up
through the islands, and the second morning
later slips into a little cove behind some high
hills with trees along the banks&mdash;in Georgia
Strait. Twenty-four hours we lay there, and
then we hears a steamer's wheel, but we don't
see her; only a couple of hours later the owner
comes for me in a big ship's quarter-boat, and we
work the <i>Hattie</i> over to a little island where we
find a lot of bales wrapped in burlap and hid in
a cook's shack.</p>

<p>"'That all?' I asks my new owner&mdash;Durks his
name.</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes&mdash;there's a couple o' Chinamen here.
But let's see&mdash;where are they?' He looks around.
'They're not here&mdash;strolling in the woods somewhere.
We'll take them along, too,' he says.
'You won't mind that, will you?'</p>

<p>"Now there was nothing in the contract about
Chinamen, and I didn't like the notion of him
working 'em aboard in that way, but I said all
<span class='pagenum'>[205]</span>
right and soon as dark came we'd roll 'em aboard
and put out.</p>

<p>"Well, the boss and I sits down to lunch in
the cook-house, and by and by, with nothing to
do but wait for dark, we stroll around the island.
Now I'm no wizard in anything, but I always
did have a good ear. And no harm at all, a
good ear, when you got to do most of your own
watching out. Before we'd gone far I knew somebody
was trailing me and the new owner. I
could hear steps behind us an' dead twigs snapping
and somebody shoving aside branches, and
once, when we stopped for a talk on the edge of
a clearing, I knew I heard somebody breathing
just behind the bushes which was hanging over
the logs we were sitting on.</p>

<p>"Now I knew that this Durks wasn't very popular
in the quarters where he did business, and
's I wasn't aching to have any Chinese tong man
hit me over the head with any hatchet by mistake
in a shaded wood, I just naturally fell out of
step and lost him, and being some trailer myself,
I took to trailing whoever it was 'd been trailing
me and Durks, and by and by I come up behind
him, and when I do I grip him where he won't
make too much noise nor do me too much harm
till I let him. He wasn't a very big chap, nor
any too strong, and I sets him down on the nearest
old tree trunk and&mdash;'What is it?' I asks.
<span class='pagenum'>[206]</span></p>

<p>"He looks at me and shakes his head and says,
'No sabby,' and I looks at him and I shakes my
head and says: 'Oh, yes, you do, Johnnie Sing.
I wasn't wearing any whiskers when I used to
meet you in Wall-Eye Bunsen's place. I've cultivated
them for protective purposes only, to hide
my face but not my intelligence&mdash;so you just
overlook them and try and recollect Alec Corning.
Now what d' y' say?'</p>

<p>"'Halloo, Captain Corning!' he says; and, no
pretending, he was glad to see me.</p>

<p>"'Whitely,' I says&mdash;'Bill Whitely when you
say it out loud. What's your trouble, Johnnie?'
And so you c'n all get it right, I ought to say
first that Johnnie Sing was a sort of Americanized
Chinaman, who the last time I'd seen him was
inquiring if he couldn't become a real American
some way. He'd been born in Lima on the West
Coast, where there's a big colony o' Chinamen,
and he was part Chinese, the rest of him Peruvian
Indian. A Christian, too, he was; which
I'm not putting up as being for or against him,
except so you'll see he had as much right to be
a Christian as anything else. His mother was
Christian, and so it wasn't like as if he had turned
against his own to get on in the world.</p>

<p>"Johnnie was a good sort, and he'd made a
few dollars in the tea business, and so maybe
ought to 'a' been happy. But he wasn't. There
<span class='pagenum'>[207]</span>
was an old Chinaman, and not too old either,
who'd married a Finn woman came off a wrecked
Norwegian bark. They ran a laundry together,
and by'n'by they came on to Frisco and ran a
laundry there. And Johnnie followed them. A
good woman, and she died leaving a well-grown
little girl, and by'n'by the old fellow he figures
he's made enough and goes back to have a look
at China. But no sooner there than he learns
he won't live very long, and he writes Johnnie of
it, or maybe it was the girl did, her and Johnnie
having been always about three-quarters in love
with each other. And Johnnie he cruises over to
China, and the old fellow, savvying how things
are, says all right, marry, and they get married,
and he gives 'em his blessing and lays down and
dies. A good old scout, Johnnie said, and I guess
he was.</p>

<p>"Well, everything's fine, only Johnnie wants to
come back and live in the United States, and the
girl too. She was sixteen years old when she left
California, and a woman's life in the United States
looked a lot better to her than in this land of one-half
her ancestors. So she and Johnnie takes a
steamer to Vancouver, and they get there all right;
but not till they got there did either of them happen
to think that they were foreigners and barred
as Chinese from coming into the United States.
<span class='pagenum'>[208]</span>
Which was a pity, they being pretty white and so
strong for everything American. Anyway, Johnnie
writes to Trumbull, my old boss, to see what
he could do, and after ten days or so Durks
happens along and bumps into Johnnie and is
surprised as you please to see him, and Johnnie
tells him his story, and Durks tells him not to
worry about that&mdash;that he'd smuggle him and
his wife across in a schooner he'd just bought.
They would take a little coast steamer and meet
her a few hours up the coast, and then across the
sound to Seattle&mdash;'twould be the easiest thing
ever you see.</p>

<p>"And there they were, Johnnie and his wife,
and when he got that far in his story Johnnie
stops and looks up at the sky most mournful-like.
Springtime it was, mind you, and fine weather,
with the sun shining and the waters of the inlet
rolling up on the rocks gentle-like, and the first
of the birds were up from the south and singing
and chirping, and, I s'pose, nesting overhead&mdash;a
bran'-new spring day in a piny grove on a pretty
little island off the coast of British Columbia,
when anybody should 'a' been happy, 'specially
with a new young wife.</p>

<p>"'Well, what's wrong&mdash;what you so blue about?'
I asks Johnnie when he'd got through squinting
up the tree branches to the sky.
<span class='pagenum'>[209]</span></p>

<p>"And he tells me how after his wife was aboard
the steamer which 'd brought 'em to this place she
sees Durks and tells Johnnie how Durks came
near kidnapping her one time&mdash;before she went
back to China with her father. Her father and
Durks had a terrible row over it. Her father
near killed Durks with a hatchet. And now here
was Durks turning up in this accidental way; too
accidental altogether&mdash;for Durks. He would steal
her or something, and once he got her into San
Francisco they could be swallowed up with her.
Huh&mdash;a Chinese row, the police would say, and
not bother too much. Not like stealing an American
girl. 'And if he gives me over to the police,
I am not an American citizen&mdash;out of the country
I must go,' winds up Johnnie.</p>

<p>"Terrible downcast is Johnnie Sing, but I stands
him on his feet and tells him to cheer up. Durks
was head of the expedition, yes, and paying the
bills, yes; but me, Alec Corning, was skipper of
the <i>Hattie</i>. 'Go down and tell your little wife
that everything'll be all right,' says I&mdash;'that Alec
Corning'll be on the job. Where is she?'</p>

<p>"'She is here,' he says, and whistles, and out
from the brush steps a cute little girl dressed like
a man, and with a hard hat to make her look all
the more like a man. Johnnie lifted the little
hat, and under it she has a lot of yellow-ash hair
<span class='pagenum'>[210]</span>
coiled up where a reg'lar Chinaman 'd have only
a black pigtail.</p>

<p>"'Don't let on to Durks either of you ever saw
me in your life,' I advises 'em, 'and when it's
time to go aboard the vessel you go.'</p>

<p>"And they went aboard with what Durks says
was bales of hemp; and we put out that night in
open water, and next day threading inside passages
so far as we could. Another night and
another morning found us in Puget Sound, and
there on a little neck of land on the American
shore we hoisted our load of hemp onto a little,
rough-made wooden pier. A narrow-gauge track
ran up from the pier, and standing on the track
was a hand flat car.</p>

<p>"'Now,' says Durks, 'I will pay off" these men,
so they won't be hanging around and possibly
talking too much before we get clear.' And he
did&mdash;- ten dollars to the hands and fifteen to the
cook, and a silver dollar all around for car-fare.
And they went ashore, he telling them where
they would find a little branch station about a
mile up the road to take them to Seattle. And
so we got through with them.</p>

<p>"He himself goes ashore after they're out the
way, and stays an hour or so, and when he's
back, 'How about paying off me and my mate
now?' I asks.
<span class='pagenum'>[211]</span></p>

<p>"'You take the schooner to a little place west
of here and then I'll pay you both off,' he answers.</p>

<p>"'And how about landing those two passengers?'
I asks.</p>

<p>"'No, no, don't land them here,' he says.
'Somebody might see them and pounce on us for
landing them. Keep them aboard for a while&mdash;to
the next anchorage.'</p>

<p>"And we put out late in the morning then, and,
there being no wind, 'twas in the middle of the
afternoon before we came to anchor in a little
harbor about five miles from where we landed
the cargo. And we'd hardly been there when an
American gunboat comes to anchor just off our
hiding-place, and Archie and me we looks at each
other, but don't say anything.</p>

<p>"And Durks? He's terribly surprised at the
sight of the gunboat&mdash;terribly. By and by he
stops walking the deck and says to me: 'I have
a plan, captain. I will go aboard that gunboat
and find out what they want here. If they think
there is anything wrong about us, I will invite
them to come aboard and look us over. What
do you say to that?'</p>

<p>"I didn't say anything to it, but 'What will
become of me and my wife&mdash;I paid you five hundred
dollars for us?' pipes up Johnnie Sing.
<span class='pagenum'>[212]</span></p>

<p>"'Why'&mdash;and Durks smiles&mdash;'that is easy.
You can hide&mdash;oh, where now? Why, of course,
in the lazaretto. And your wife in a locker somewhere
that Captain Corning will pick out for her.
They will not look far, even if they shall suspect
us&mdash;they will think we would have fifty or a hundred
aboard or none at all. So they will not
look into every corner. If you both hide away
somewhere everything will be all right.'</p>

<p>"Johnnie is uneasy, but I nods my head to
him on the sly, and he says all right and goes
below with his wife. And making sure they are
below, Durks turns to me and hands over five
hundred to me, and to Archie two hundred dollars.
And he shows us another five hundred and
says: 'And this will be for you two to divide
as you please when I get Johnnie Sing away from
the ship and the girl is left behind. What do
you say?'</p>

<p>"And I looks over at the five hundred and
says, 'It looks pretty good'; and Archie he looks
at me and at the extra money and says, 'It looks
pretty good'; and Durks laughs and says, 'It will
feel pretty good, too; but better put that money
out of sight, hadn't you, captain&mdash;and you too,
Mr. Gillis?' and goes off in the big quarter-boat&mdash;the
only boat we had aboard, by the way.</p>

<p>"No sooner was he gone than up pops Johnnie
<span class='pagenum'>[213]</span>
Sing out of the cabin companionway. 'Captain,'
he says, 'must I hide away?'</p>

<p>"Can you swim?'</p>

<p>"'A little bit.'</p>

<p>"'A little bit? Not enough. And your wife?'</p>

<p>"From over his shoulder she shook her head.</p>

<p>"'Then you can't swim ashore, can you? You
got to stay aboard, that's plain. Well, you and
your wife go with Mr. Gillis, who'll stow you in
a place he knows under the forec's'le floor. Neither
o' you bein' too tall or too fat, you c'n stow
away in this place without smotherin' for an hour
or two. We've used it before. Go by way of
the cabin and through the hold below decks, so
if anybody's got a glass on us from the gunboat
they won't see you.'</p>

<p>"And they went, she crawling behind him like
a little mouse. And Archie tucked 'em away
and comes on deck, looking at his money as he
comes&mdash;two one-hundred-dollar bills. 'Tuck it
out o' sight!' Archie was sayin'&mdash;'tuck it out o'
sight, hah?' And the more he looks the more
doubtful he becomes, and I looks at mine, and I
get a magnifyin' glass from my dunnage to have
a closer look, and sure enough it's the phony kind
of money men like Durks used sometimes to pass
off on unsuspecting Chinks on that coast. 'Johnnie
Sing tips me off about it just now,' explains
Archie to me.
<span class='pagenum'>[214]</span></p>

<p>"And while we're swearing at Durks for that,
back he comes with a young officer and four
armed sailors. The officer looks at me and says:
'You have contraband Chinamen aboard here?'</p>

<p>"Well, that got me. I looks at him, and then,
thinking of the phony money, I looks at Durks.
And I don't answer.</p>

<p>"'We shall have to search the ship,' says the
officer.</p>

<p>"'Sure,' I says, 'search away.'</p>

<p>"And they went and dropped straight into the
cabin and made for the lazaretto, Durks waiting
and whistling to himself on deck. Pretty soon
the officer comes up and reports nobody in the
lazaretto. Durks goes up in the air. 'Where is
he?' he says to me.</p>

<p>"'He? Who?'</p>

<p>"'Johnnie Sing.'</p>

<p>"'What you talkin' about?' I asks, and at the
same time Archie carelessly hauls out a hundred-dollar
bill and lights a cigarette with it. And
Durks suddenly changes, and with the officer's
permission steps with me into the cabin. And
the first thing he does is to count out seven hundred
dollars good money and hand it to me. 'I
took that other from the wrong pile,' he says, and
smiles, but not as if he expects to be believed.
And he holds out another five hundred&mdash;good
<span class='pagenum'>[215]</span>
money&mdash;and says, 'Where are they?' And I
looks wise and says, 'Suppose that Chink gave
me a thousand to get 'em clear?' 'A thousand?
Well, here&mdash;here's a thousand when you turn him
over to me. Where are they?'</p>

<p>"And I whispered, so the lockers themselves
couldn't hear me: 'They swam ashore and are
hid away. To-morrow morning I give them the
signal and they'll come back aboard.'</p>

<p>"'Then,' says Durks, 'you can get his five
hundred and my thousand. Will that satisfy you?'</p>

<p>"And I said I'd think it over, and we went on
deck, where Durks told the officer there might
be a way to get hold of the contraband Chinamen
yet. And the officer eyes us both and finally
says: 'You'd better both come with me to the
ship and make it clear to the captain. He is
now up the Sound, but will be aboard in the
morning. And we went, leaving Archie to look
after the vessel.</p>

<p>"We went aboard the gunboat, not exactly
under guard, but just so's to be sure we'd be there
when we were wanted. It was now getting on
toward six o'clock, and the first thing meal call
blew, and up steps an old shipmate, Ed Gurney,
and invites me down to the chief petty officers'
mess for supper.</p>

<p>"Ed and me we'd been snapper-fishing together
<span class='pagenum'>[216]</span>
in the Gulf o' Mexico, on the Campeche
Bank, in one of those little short bowsprit schooners
out o' Pensacola, and now he was high-line
marksman of the ship, wore extra marks on his
sleeve and got extra money, and all that kind o'
stuff, for his shooting. Well, Ed always could
tell an oil-tanker from a banana steamer as far
as any man in the Gulf, and we talked of those
days during supper, and after we'd had a good
smoke we walked the deck together, talking of
one thing and another, and before I got through
I told him all about the scrape I was in.</p>

<p>"'The grab-all snake!' says Ed. 'And what
you goin' to do, Alec?'</p>

<p>"'My name is Bill,' I answers; 'Bill Whitely if
there's anybody likely to be in hearing. But I
tell you, Ed,' I says, 'I don't like the notion o'
little Johnnie Sing and his wife getting caught&mdash;or
separated.'</p>

<p>"We were looking over the side then, where to
the boom was tied a string of small boats, our big
quarter-boat to the end.</p>

<p>"'What do you know about this fellow Durks,
Ed?' I said, after a time.</p>

<p>"'Nothing,' he said, 'except that he's under
suspicion of smuggling opium for a long time.
They say he's money-mad and woman-mad, and
always was.'
<span class='pagenum'>[217]</span></p>

<p>"'So I've heard. And what's his game here
with me?'</p>

<p>"'It's going around the ship that you ran
away with his schooner and smuggled a Chink
aboard unbeknownst, but that he's going to forgive
you if you hand over the Chinaman and
so put him right with the Gover'ment. He didn't
say anything about any woman.'</p>

<p>"'He's one fine gentleman,' I says. And, by
'n' by: 'Suppose you saw somebody was trying
to slip the <i>Hattie</i>&mdash;the <i>Pioneer</i>&mdash;out by you in the
dark, what would happen?'</p>

<p>"'Happen?' says Ed. 'A lot o' things. And
quick. It'd be up with a lot of three-inch ammunition,
and some high-rating gun pointer, who's
as likely to be me as anybody else, would probably
have to use you for a little target practice.'</p>

<p>"'And you c'n lay 'em pretty close aboard,
can't you, Ed&mdash;strings o' bull's-eyes at six and
eight and ten thousand yards&mdash;hah?'</p>

<p>"'I have landed 'em as close as that,' says Ed.</p>

<p>"'But an old shipmate, Ed?' I says.</p>

<p>"'Now, Alec&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Bill&mdash;Bill Whitely,' I says.</p>

<p>"'Well, Bill Whitely, then, though you'd better
let me call you Alec. I think I'd shoot a bit
wider thinking of Alec Corning than anybody
named Bill Whitely. If you don't leave me any
<span class='pagenum'>[218]</span>
other way out of it, I'd maybe keep scraping the
paint off you as long as I could.'</p>

<p>"'Your idea bein' to do the right thing by the
Gover'ment in the end, Ed?'</p>

<p>"'That's it,' says Ed.</p>

<p>"'Well, Ed,' I says, 'if you should happen to
see such a thing as a moving picture of the <i>Hattie</i>
stealin' out to sea, and it's up to you to bring
her to, say at five or six or eight thousand yards,
just scrape the paint with the first two or three,
will you, by way o' telling me how it's you, Ed?'</p>

<p>"'All right,' says Ed.</p>

<p>"'And we shook hands over that. 'And maybe
the Gover'ment won't be losing anything at that,'
I says.</p>

<p>"After a time Ed Gurney left me to go on the
night watch, and I was standing by the rail, figuring
how I was going to get back to the <i>Hattie</i>,
when Durks comes looking for me.</p>

<p>"'Of course,' says Durks, 'you had no idea of
it, but I organized this expedition as much to
get Johnnie Sing out of the way and separate
him from his wife as to smuggle in the cargo of
hemp.'</p>

<p>"'The duty on hemp,' I interrupts, 'must be
very high, Mr. Durks.'</p>

<p>"'What? It is&mdash;yes,' he says.</p>

<p>"'And how much <i>is</i> the duty on hemp?' I asks.
<span class='pagenum'>[219]</span></p>

<p>"And he don't know. 'Hemp, humph!' I says,
'how much is the duty on&mdash;?' and I stops.</p>

<p>"'On what?' he says.</p>

<p>"'On whatever's in those bales?' I answers.</p>

<p>"'Why, what is the duty?' he asks.</p>

<p>"Maybe there's no duty&mdash;maybe it's against
the law to bring it in, no matter what the duty,'
I answers.</p>

<p>"And he sees I know too much, and from out
of a pocket inside his vest he draws a package of
money and lets me look to see how much, and he
says: 'Five hundred now and five hundred when
you turn over to me Johnnie Sing&mdash;separate from
his wife.'</p>

<p>"'If I could get back on the schooner,' I says,
like I was studying it out, 'back on her to-night,
I'd guarantee I'd have Johnnie Sing aboard her
in the morning.'</p>

<p>"'But how can you get off this ship?' he says.</p>

<p>"'Easy enough,' I says. 'Nobody here cares
whether I stay aboard or get away, and nobody's
watching me too close. You ask the executive
officer's permission to go down aboard your quarter-boat,
swinging from the boom there, by way
of seeing it's all right, and you get into it and
look it over, and the last thing you do before
leaving it you unfasten the painter and let her
go adrift. And in the morning, when you see the
<span class='pagenum'>[220]</span>
<i>Hattie</i>, Johnnie Sing and his wife will be aboard&mdash;- on
her deck in plain sight. And then you come
and get 'em. But you'll have to come and get
'em yourself&mdash;and give me five hundred dollars
now on account&mdash;good money, mind.' And he
does&mdash;good money.</p>

<p>"And while he's going down over the boom
ladder to one side I'm climbing down a side ladder
on the other, and soon standing on the last
rung, just above the water-line, and waiting. And
pretty soon I see the shadow of our quarter-boat
drifting past her stern, and as I do I slips overboard
and strikes out for her, quiet and mostly
under water, because I had my clothes on.</p>

<p>"I get aboard the quarter-boat and I let her
drift till maybe I am a quarter of a mile away,
and then I out oars and heads her in for where
I can see the <i>Hattie's</i> riding light. I comes alongside.
Archie's shape looms up over the rail.
'Hi-i!' he yells, 'keep off!' 'It's all right, Archie,'
I says, and he reaches down and takes the
painter. 'What's doing?' he says.</p>

<p>"'Where's Johnnie Sing and his wife?'</p>

<p>"'She's asleep in the cabin and he's awake
watching her. What you going to do?'</p>

<p>"'You tell Johnnie here's his five hundred
passage money back, will you, Archie? And
then we'll make ready to skip out of here.'
<span class='pagenum'>[221]</span></p>

<p>"'Skip out? Not enough wind,' says Archie.</p>

<p>"'Not now,' I says, 'but there will be.'</p>

<p>"'I hope so,' says Archie, and calls Johnnie
and tells him, and I gives him his money which
he didn't want to take but had to and we slip
her chain cable but left her riding light on a buoy
in case the gunboat watch were having an eye
on her. 'And now,' I says, 'to that lighter where
those bales of hemp are.'</p>

<p>"'Hadn't we better put straight for the open
sound and head to sea,' says Archie, 'while it's
dark? What do we want with a lot o' hemp?'
growls Archie.</p>

<p>"'We'll go after the hemp, all the same, Archie,'
I says.</p>

<p>"It took us three hours from our anchorage to
make the lighter, where the hemp was, and that
made it midnight. We let the schooner drift a
couple of hundred yards off the little pier, and
Archie and me paddled ashore in our quarter-boat
with a spare lantern.</p>

<p>"There was the lighter, but no bales of hemp.
Up on the pier, about two hundred yards, we
see a streak of light. We crept up to that, and
through a pane of glass high up&mdash;me standing
on Archie's shoulders to get a look through&mdash;was
four men playing cards, with money and a bottle
of whiskey and a kerosene lamp on the table.
<span class='pagenum'>[222]</span>
We looked around. On the narrow-gauge railroad
track we found the little flat hand-car, and
on that, under a tarpaulin, were the bales of hemp.</p>

<p>"We crept around to the door of the shack.
By feeling we saw it opened out; so the two of
us felt around for big-sized stones, a hundred
pounds apiece, or so, and them we piled in front
of the door, fifteen or twenty of 'em, very softly,
and then I whispers to Archie to hustle the flat
car along to the pier.</p>

<p>"And he did, but in getting started the car
wheels grinded a little, and somebody inside yells,
'What's that!' and again, 'Listen!' and then I
could hear one of 'em jumping up and cursing
and swearing: 'What started her?' Next thing
somebody rattled the door-latch and pushed.
And pushed again. And then&mdash;bam! his whole
weight against the door. The top part springs
out, but the bottom half sticks.</p>

<p>"Then there was a quiet, and then somebody
said something quick, and I could hear 'em all
jumping up and yelling out, and they came piling
bang-up for the door and slammed against
it, but the big stones held 'em. Then they stopped,
and one of 'em says: 'We're locked in all right.'
'Yes,' I calls out, 'and you'd better stay locked
in, for the first man, and the second man, and
the third man comes out the door he gets his.
<span class='pagenum'>[223]</span>
And now, men,' I calls out, 'keep that door covered
and cut loose if it's knocked open.' And
then I hurried after Archie's lantern, which I see
is now to the pier.</p>

<p>"It didn't take us more than a couple o' minutes
to pitch those little bales off that car, tote
'em across the lighter and drop 'em into our quarter-boat.
Then we rowed out to our vessel and
threw them over the rail and let 'em lay there
amidships till we could get a chance to rip 'em
open and see what we got.</p>

<p>"It was then two o'clock, and 's by this time
the breeze'd made a bit, I was hoping we'd slip
by the gunboat before daylight. And we did&mdash;almost;
but not far enough by. Before the sun
was fair up they saw us and puts after us. It
took her a few minutes to get under way and
steam up on her, and then she came a-belting.
Twelve knots she was probably steaming, but by
now the breeze was strong enough for the <i>Hattie</i>
to hold her own, but not to draw away. And
soon the breeze comes stronger, and we begin to
lengthen and draw away from the gunboat. And
it breezed up more, and the <i>Hattie</i>, balloon and
stays'l on now, and taking it over her quarter,
was beginning to show the stuff in her.</p>

<p>"She was lifting her forefoot and kicking her
way through like she knew what we wanted. We
<span class='pagenum'>[224]</span>
were walking away from the gunboat, and I was
wondering why she didn't reach out for us with
one of her long five-inch lads. But I see why
pretty soon. In the clearing light a point of land
shows up ahead of us, making out maybe a couple of
miles to the windward of our course. We couldn't
turn out, for here was the main shore and there
was the gunboat. 'And a pity, too,' I says to
Archie, 'with enough opium aboard to keep us
many a year.'</p>

<p>"Archie'd 'most forgot the bales. 'Cut 'em
open,' I says to him, and he did, and out they
come&mdash;six or eight pound tins they looked&mdash;dozens
of 'em. And Archie, looking at the bright shiny
tins, said, 'What a pity!' again, and we both said
what a pity it was, too, for Johnnie Sing and his
wife. 'But don't you worry about 'em,' I says;
'Nor you about your wife,' I says to Johnnie, who
was looking heart-broken, with his arm around her.</p>

<p>"All the time we were hopping on toward the
point, and if 'twas anything but a steamer with
guns was chasing us we'd 'a' squeezed by, and,
once by, it was good night to the gunboat or anything
like her in that breeze. It looked that way
even as it was, till a shell goes skipping across the
water ahead of us. In half a minute there came
another one astern. There wasn't any sea on
this time&mdash;inshore this and the water smooth, and
<span class='pagenum'>[225]</span>
the two shells had a fine chance to show how they
could pile up little hills of water and then go skipping
across the surface, making quarter circles to
the right. I had hopes, a few hopes yet. For
the wind was still there, and the <i>Hattie</i> she had
everything on her, and she was pirooting 'tween
earth and sky like a picnic swing. And looking
out in terror was Johnnie Sing's little wife, and
I was saying to her: 'She's all right&mdash;she'll
stay up, never fear.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, she'll stay up,' says Archie, 'if one of
them shells don't come aboard,' and we both
eying a flash o' flame that just then came out the
side of the gunboat.</p>

<p>"'They're only fourteen-pounders,' I says.</p>

<p>"'Is that all?' says Archie. 'Only fourteen
pounds o' nitroglycerine, or cordite, or dynamite,
or guncotton, or whatever 'tis they packs into
'em! Only fourteen pounds!&mdash;and fourteen ounces
is enough to send the <i>Hattie</i> to the clouds and
eternal glory if ever it comes aboard,' and just
then one came right under her forefoot and another
under her counter. And I looks back to
the gunboat. She's less than a mile away now,
and I takes the glasses and has a peek, and I
imagines I sees a tall, rangy lad standing beside
a long, slim, steel-shiny, needle-lookin' gun, and
I says to myself: 'Eddie boy, you miss us about
<span class='pagenum'>[226]</span>
twice more and Alec Corning'll be buying you
more than one drink next time we meet,' for I
knew the end was near. Ahead of me I see a
passage making an island of the last half mile o'
that point o' land, and it looked like water enough
in the passage to let the <i>Hattie</i> through.</p>

<p>"I calls out to Archie and tells him to heave
the tins of opium into the quarter-boat, and he
did, and 'Now get into her,' I says, 'and pull for
the beach.' And they did, me staying aboard the
<i>Hattie</i> to luff her for them to get away. And
then I cut the stays'l free and gave the <i>Hattie</i>
her wheel again, and when she was going full-tilt
I jibed her over, and she had everything on, and
it was blowing blue devils, and only one thing
you'd think could happen after that long main-boom
went swinging across her deck&mdash;over the
side had to go her spars. But they didn't. A
twenty-two-inch forem'st she carried, a great
stick, and when she was away again and going
straight for the passage I says to myself: 'You'll
have to hurry, Ed Gurney, or I'll be beating you
to it!' For after all, when you're put to it, Durks
or no Durks, there's only one thing to do&mdash;try
and save your vessel.</p>

<span class="caption">"Just then one came right under her forefoot and another

</div>

<p>"The <i>Hattie</i> rushes straight for the passage, and
I thought maybe she'd make it, when whing!
whing! whing! you'd think somebody was trying
<span class='pagenum'>[227]</span>
to cut his initials in the water around her.
One after the other, like somebody having fun
with her, and then wr-r-t! I felt her shiver, and
then she seemed to shake herself, and then straight
into the air her bowsprit seemed to rise and point
to the morning sky, and from out of her waist
came flame and smoke. Straight on and up the
bowsprit went, and down! and plump! her after-part
went! and flying junks of one thing and another
filled the air, and some smoke, and then in
the sea around the small parts that'd blown up
began to fall. But I wasn't watching them. I
was watching the for'ard half of her as it went
pitching up, the bowsprit making a quarter circle
in the air, and then plunk! down and under. The
great little <i>Hattie</i> was gone. By that time I was
in the water reaching out for the quarter-boat.</p>

<p>"'Too bad,' says Archie, 'too bad!' when I was
safe in her. 'Too bad!' he says, and stops rowing.
'Pull, you sentimental loafer; pull for the
beach!' I yells at him.</p>

<p>"And he did, and we all did&mdash;all but Johnnie's
wife&mdash;and landed, and ran up and hid in the
brush up top of the cliff, and lay on our stomachs
watching the gunboat come stealing in and put
off a steam-barge and grab our quarter-boat with
all the opium in it. And we could hear Ed Gurney
whoop when he held a tin of it aloft. 'Man,
<span class='pagenum'>[228]</span>
tons of it, tons of it!' Archie swore he could hear
Ed yelling, and we guessed that would square him
for those few wide shots. And then they headed
back and went aboard the gunboat, and pretty
soon she steamed off.</p>

<p>'Vessel and opium both gone&mdash;I wonder how
Durks is feeling now,' says Archie; 'and we with
his&mdash;but how much is it altogether, Alec?' And
that reminded me, and I says to Archie, 'Where'd
you leave your two hundred dollars?' and he
stops and swears. He'd left it under his mattress
in the cabin of the <i>Hattie</i>. And I'd left my five
hundred hanging up in my coat in the cabin of
the <i>Hattie</i>, and there she was in ten fathom of
water. I broke the news to Archie.</p>

<p>"Archie said he'd be damned. Then: 'How'll
we get out of here? For we gotta go east after
this, Alec.'</p>

<p>"And Johnnie Sing, listening, takes the five
hundred I'd given him and hands it to me. I don't
want to take it, and he says, 'Plenty more&mdash;see,'
and with his jackknife begins opening the wadding
of his coat, and out come bills and bills and bills.
All his property, twenty-odd thousand dollars,
was sewed up there in big bills. And when 'twas
all out he offers it to us, telling us to help ourselves.
And Archie and me said no, the five
hundred would do us to pay our way back to
<span class='pagenum'>[229]</span>
Gloucester here, and meals on the way, o' course.
And Johnnie, by our advice, he comes east, too,
with his little wife, and stepped off in New York;
and that's where we left him.</p>

<p>"A fine little team, Johnnie and his wife. And
the <i>Hattie</i>? If there's any of you never seen her,
then you ought to when she was alive. A great
little vessel, the <i>Hattie Rennish</i>!"</p>

KILLORIN'S CARIBBEAN DAYS</h2>


<p>Revolutions? These days? In those
South American countries? Sh-h, boy, sh-h&mdash;you
don't know. In th' old gunboat days in
the Caribbeans we never called it a good week
'nless we suppressed three or four. And at that
I think we used to miss some.</p>

<p>Believe me, son, those were the days when they
knew how to revolutionize. You'd turn in of a
night with the Blues or the Reds or Greens, in,
and have breakfast maybe in the mornin' with the
Purples or the Violets and brass bands celebratin'
the vict'ry in the Palace square.</p>

<p>And the first thing every new party did when
they got in was to start up the Bureau of Printin'
'nd Engravin' and roll off a few billion dollars of
gover'ment money. In Guadalquique the money
for all parties was the same, except each party
used to rubber-stamp its name across the face.
An old navy yeoman hit the beach there one
time named Tommie Anderson and he was made
chief of the Bureau o' Printin' 'nd Engravin' by
the Greens because he could make a rubber hand-stamp
<span class='pagenum'>[234]</span>
while they waited. Some traitor who didn't
get his 'd absconded with the 'ficial one, Tommie
said.</p>

<p>Of course that kind o' work tends to debilitate
the best kind o' money. In Almatara, which was
one o' the best little revolutionary countries ever
I struck, you could see nigger boot-blacks shootin'
crap for two or three thousand dollars a throw
of a holiday in the market square. It used to
cost a thousand dollars for a shine&mdash;that's a first-class
shine for a foreigner, I mean. The natives
didn't have to pay that much.</p>

<p>Yes sir, son, a great old cruisin'-ground in the
old days, the Caribbeans, and fine times there,
believe me. In the old <i>Hiawatha</i> we'd be layin'
in to Kingston, or Havana, or Matanzas, or some
port along there, with big liberty parties ashore
every day, when word 'd come from Washington
tellin' us there was hell to pay over to Guadalquique,
or Almatara, or somewhere else, and for
us to beat it over there and sit on 'em before they
got going.</p>

<p>The <i>Hiawatha</i> she was a good old gunboat
ratin' four fourteen and two six-pounders, and,
bein' the handiest thing in the fleet, 'twas always
her they detailed for those little revolutionary
jobs, and aboard her we got so, after a while, we
didn't mind the report of a new revolution any
<span class='pagenum'>[235]</span>
more 'n you'd mind the ringin' of the cash-register
in a barroom up here. Sometimes you'd see the
skipper showin' signs of impatience, rumplin' his
hair and rubbin' his chin and maybe cussin' a
little; but he always ended by hurryin' a patrol
party ashore, and we'd beat up the grog-shops 'n'
the dance-halls and the park benches and hustle
everybody aboard, and the chief engineer he'd
rouse out a couple of extra stokers, and up steam
and away we'd go.</p>

<p>Foolish things&mdash;revolutions? Maybe. But people
who say no good can come out o' revolutions,
they don't know. I got rank an' fortune
out of a revolution one time. Yes, sir, me, Killorin,
bosun's mate, second class, U. S. N., and
on my first Caribbean cruise it was, and&mdash;but I'll
get to the rest of it. When I was drafted to the
<i>Hiawatha</i> on the Caribbean station I had what
you might call only a virgin notion of revolutions.
My first enlistment was 'most run out,
and I was looking to be put aboard some home-bound
ship, but I was still on the <i>Hiawatha</i> when
she was told to jog along over to Tangarine, a
bustling young republic which was beginnin' to
make a name for itself in the revolutionary way.</p>

<p>Whatever they were doin' we were to stop it.
That was the Monroe Doctrine, the officers said.
And so we put over there, but we didn't stop it.
<span class='pagenum'>[236]</span>
It was all over, with the Reds in an' printin' new
money and postage-stamps and makin' a bluff to
collect customs fine as could be when we got there.</p>

<p>There was nothin' to keep us there, but it was
a fruitful-lookin' country and the skipper he
thought he might 's well get a little fresh grub
for his mess, and he sends me ashore to do the
buyin'. And I goes. And the first grocery store
I come to I says to the man behind the counter:
"How much for a ham?" And he says, quick
and brisk, "Four thousand dollars," and I was
most stunned, but I manages to slap a five-dollar
gold piece down on the counter and I says, quick
and brisk too: "In God's name gimme a bite out
of it!" An' I had to hire two coolies to wheel
the change back to the ship.</p>

<p>Well, the money values of that Tangarine place
had me mesmerized, and when my time ran out
a few weeks later I settles up with the paymaster
and stands by to go over the side with my bag.
The skipper he says: "Killorin, I'll be over here
by'n'by and take you off. And you'll be glad
to come, I'll wager." And I says, "Thank you,
sir, but this is the dolsee far nanity country for
me. With the number o' gold pieces I got in my
pants pocket I oughter be able to pass the rest
o' my days here," and with my big ticket and
my bag I hit the beach in Tangarine, intendin' to
<span class='pagenum'>[237]</span>
go straight to the palace and get chummy with
the new President first thing.</p>

<p>But I never got so far as the palace. Not that
time. About a quarter-mile up from the beach
was a joyous-lookin' hotel with shaded verandas
all 'round and a banana grove in the yard, and
on a second look a <i>cantina</i> shinin' with mirrors
and glasses and colored bottles on the ground
floor, and on another look spacious-lookin' suites
o' rooms such as were befittin' to <i>se&ntilde;ors</i> of wealth
and leisure on the floor above. And over these
premises I cast one sailor-like view, and through
the for'ard gangway of that glass-mounted <i>cantina</i>
I hove my clothes-bag and myself followed
after. There was also a roulette wheel, which
didn't hurt the looks of the place either.</p>

<p>I felt so right to home that I anchored right
there&mdash;oh, three or four or five or six days; maybe
it was two weeks; but anyway&mdash;all that don't
matter&mdash;when I steadied down so's to reason like
the man o' sense my skipper always used to say
I was at bottom, I was down on the beach and
it was early in the mornin', and I was watchin'
a lemon-colored sun trying to rise out of the
smooth Caribbean sea, and I was wonderin' where
it was I'd mislaid my clothes-bag. I could account
for everythin' but my clothes-bag. But that
don't matter either now. I never saw it again.
<span class='pagenum'>[238]</span></p>

<p>And while I sat there, not feelin' just like a
high-score gun-captain after target-practice, I
hears a light step behind me, and pretty soon I
could feel an eye looking me over, and by'n'by
a voice said: "A ver-ry fine good morning, sir."</p>

<p>"Is it?" I says, and I looks up to see who the
cheerful party is. And there was a good-lookin',
well-dressed, young, dark-complected chap, with a
little bamboo cane which he kept stickin' into the
sand.</p>

<p>And he looks at me again and says, plainly
pleased and yet a little sad, too: "The Blues are
in." And I says: "That so? Since when?" And
he says: "Since last nigh-it. You did not hear,
the revoloo-shee-onn?"</p>

<p>And I says: "I didn't&mdash;I must 'a' been takin'
a nap." But I guessed it was a good thing; leastways
they couldn't be any worse than the Reds&mdash;or
was it the Yellow chaps were in last?</p>

<p>"No Yellow in Tangarine," he says.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" I says&mdash;"an authority."</p>

<p>"No Yellow&mdash;Blues and Reds only. And as
for the Reds, bah! But the Blues, good&mdash;ver-ry
good," and he pulls the cane out of the sand,
lunges at the air, comes to a present, and says:
"I salute you, sir." And I said: "And I al-so
salute you, se&ntilde;or." And he says: "Americano?"
And I said: "You betcher." And he said: "Of
<span class='pagenum'>[239]</span>
course. Ver-ry good. I have been one time in
your country. I have studied the langooage
there, yes. Ver-ry fine, ver-ry fine. All American
people ver-ry fine. All heroes. Yes, yes,
I think so. I have read it also in your books.
But par-don, sir, what is it you do now?"</p>

<p>And I said I wasn't doing anything except makin'
up my mind whether I'd go back to the navy
or not, and if I did, how I'd get back.</p>

<p>"Ah-h, man-o'-war-man. I have thought so.
You sail ship&mdash;navigate, yes?" And I said I
didn't know about navigatin', but I could sail a
ship if I had to.</p>

<p>"I have thought so," he says. "Listen, please.
While you&mdash;compose, is it not?&mdash;your brains,
should you not wish to engage in privateerin'?
It is ver-ry good wonderful opportune time now
for that, while the Blues are in control and the
Reds who are on the ocean know not of it."</p>

<p>"H'm, we kind o' lost the privateerin' habit in
our country. How do you do it these days?" I
says.</p>

<p>"Oh-h, sir, ver-ry sim-ple, ver-ry. My friend
he is in the Blue cabinet. A fine man, yes. He
shall make for me all the privateerin' documents
I shall require. It is necessary only to request
respectfully of him. Then we shall engage a
small ship and you shall navigate her, and when
<span class='pagenum'>[240]</span>
we shall perceive other ships, the same who shall
display the Red flag, we shall display suddenly a
Blue flag on our ship and capture them."</p>

<p>"And loot 'em?"</p>

<p>"Par-don, sir," says he, "but what is that
lootem?"</p>

<p>"Why, whatever's in the ships we capture.
Don't we get everythin' we c'n find in 'em?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, of a surely, abso-lutely. It is the article
of war. But"&mdash;he holds up a finger warnin'like&mdash;"as
commander of the expedition I shall reserve
to myself one article of any kind which
shall be captured. One chest, one table, even"&mdash;he
looked at me to see if I got this part&mdash;"even
one prisoner, if I shall so desire."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right, too," I said; "for I
s'pose you're payin' for the outfittin' o' this expedition?"
And he says he was. "Then it's a
go," I says; "for I don't see but I might 's well
be privateerin' an' pickin' up a little loose loot
as lyin' around on the beach wonderin' where my
eats are comin' from f'r the next few weeks."</p>

<p>So he brings me around and shows me a little
brigantine, he'd chartered, and with three dusky
lads for a crew and some grub and two big chests
on her quarter-deck we sail out. And the first
thing I says when we were clear o' the harbor
was: "What's them chests for?" And he opens
<span class='pagenum'>[241]</span>
up one of 'em and says: "Behold, se&ntilde;or, your
uniform!"</p>

<p>And I looks and there's five gold stripes on the
sleeve of the coat to begin with. And draws it
all out, pants and all, and I see it's an admiral's
special full-dress uniform!</p>

<p>"For me?" I says.</p>

<p>"Certain-ly," he says. "You, se&ntilde;or, shall be
an admiral. Why not?"</p>

<p>"Well," I says, "I don' know why not either,
only it's some rank to start with. But what'll
you be?" And at that he opens up the other
chest and hauls out another uniform and holds
it up f'r me to look at, and, pointin' to the insignia,
he asks: "What rank shall such be?"</p>

<p>It was a general's uniform, and I tells him so.</p>

<p>"So?" he says. Then bowing to me: "Then I,
se&ntilde;or, if you do not object, shall be a gen'ral."</p>

<p>"Sure&mdash;why not, se&ntilde;or?" I says. "And there's
cert'nly some class to the quarter-deck o' this
brigantine. Let's get into 'em." And we got into
'em, an' gorgeous, oh, gorgeous, they were. An'
rememberin' the market price o' hams when I
was buyin' hams, I figured they must 'a' cost
ten or fifteen million dollars apiece. And I hadn't
been an hour in mine&mdash;solid gold almost, and a
gold-mounted shappo and a gold belt and a dazzlin'
sword&mdash;before I begins to appreciate what
<span class='pagenum'>[242]</span>
it was to be an admiral and to respect every admiral
ever I'd sailed under&mdash;except maybe two or
three&mdash;for bein' good enough to look at me at
all while they were standing round deck in their
uniforms. An' f'r the next hour I kept that
crew hoppin' from one end of the brigantine to
the other, just to see 'em hop when I gives an
order with my admiral's uniform on.</p>

<p>But after I got so I could take off my shappo
and draw my sword and look down at myself
without swellin' up, I says to the gen'ral, "What
d'y'say, se&ntilde;or gen'ral, to a little action?" and
points to a lad quarterin' down the wind toward
us with a Red flag up. "It's plain," I says, "he
don't know the Blues is in. What d'y'say if we
shake him up same as a real privateer&mdash;send a hot
shot across his forefoot and make him haul his
wind?"</p>

<p>"No, no," and the gen'ral shakes his head.</p>

<p>And soon there came another fellow inbound
and with a Red flag up, but again the gen'ral said,
"Paysheeons, paysheeons, se&ntilde;or admiral," and
raises one hand to restrain my impulsive motions.</p>

<p>And four or five more passed, all flyin' the Red
flag. But no word from the gen'ral until toward
the middle of the afternoon&mdash;and a hot afternoon
it was. The gen'ral, with the glasses to his eyes,
bounces into the air. "Ah-h!" and again, "Ah-h!"
<span class='pagenum'>[243]</span>
and points to her. "Now the fair prize-a, the
rich prize-a!" he says, and draws deep breaths,
and cinches up on his belt, and runs his fingers
between his red and green and yellow gold-mounted
collar and his neck, and runs below and
takes a last look at himself in the mirror, and
comes runnin' up on deck and calls out: "Se&ntilde;or
admiral, you shall prepare the ship for combat!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, gen'ral!" I says and takes out my
bosun's whistle, which I'd never turned in of a
night without hangin' it 'round my neck, and
which I now lifts from the breast of my gold-mounted
coat, and pipes all hands to battle
quarters. But the crew, except the one to the
wheel, was under the rail, asleep, and so I had to
enforce my pipin' with the flat of my sword. It'd
been quicker to kick 'em, but, it bein' a hot day,
I'd left off my shoes. And when they come awake
I orders 'em to fly the battle-flag, which the gen'ral
brings up from the bottom of his uniform
chest, a fine large bright-blue thing, with stars and
horned moons on it.</p>

<p>And then I makes ready a little old muzzle-loadin'
gun, which was lashed in the waist, but
pointin' over the port side, which happened to
be the wrong side when we wanted to fire a shot
across the enemy's bow. So we had to tack ship,
which took about ten minutes, my crew not bein'
<span class='pagenum'>[244]</span>
A. B.'s. But when we did fire, the noise and the
splash of water the ball threw up was war enough
for the enemy. She was about a 100-ton tradin'
schooner, and she came into the wind.</p>

<p>"Haul down your flag!" hollers the gen'ral in
the Tangarine language, and one of their crew
was goin' to haul it down, only for a stout little
chap who came runnin' up out of her cabin and
put his glasses on the gen'ral, and then rushes
over and grabs the signal halyards from the man
who was goin' to lower 'em, and hits him a clip
in the neck at the same time&mdash;a scrappy chap he
looked.</p>

<p>"He is there&mdash;it is heemself," says the gen'ral,
excitedly. But to me, very courteous, he said:
"Se&ntilde;or admiral, shall you man&oelig;uvre the ship to
approach the enemy, if you please?"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir!" I says cheerily, and puts the
brigantine alongside, and the pair of us, in our
gorgeous uniforms, we leaps aboard.</p>

<p>"Surrender!" orders the gen'ral in a commandin'
voice, but the scrappy little man he
wouldn't. He yelled somethin' at his crew, and
they got behind him. And there were four of
them against me an' the gen'ral, for our brigantine
started to drift away soon as we left her,
and our spiggity crew couldn't get her alongside
again.
<span class='pagenum'>[245]</span></p>

<p>There we were, us two heroes, marooned on the
enemy's deck, in the most magnificent uniforms,
but not another blessed thing to fight with except
a couple o' gold-plated swords. But the little captain
and his crew had only what loose things they
could grab in a hurry&mdash;oars, deck-swabs, marlin-spikes,
and one thing or another; but with them,
without wastin' any flourishes, they came at me
an' the gen'ral, and we draws our swords.</p>

<p>"What d' y' say, will we have at 'em, gen'ral?"
I says.</p>

<p>"As you say, se&ntilde;or admiral, have at 'em!"
answers the gen'ral, and we haves at 'em.</p>

<p>But I soon begin to see we wasn't havin' at
'em in any great shape. Our swords had two
backs but no edge. It was like hittin' 'em with
barrel-staves. Fine grand echoes, but the echoes
wasn't knockin' 'em down. And the gold-mounted
uniforms were in the way, too&mdash;in my way, anyway.
My gold-mounted collar was gettin' so tight
after I'd warmed up to the work that I 'most
choked.</p>

<p>"Have at 'em!" the gen'ral cried again, "but
have great care for the old gentleman."</p>

<p>I was just goin' to welt the little captain a good
one when I heard that. "Not hurt him!" I says.
"A hell of a battle this where we have to play
fav'rites among th' enemy. And why won't I
<span class='pagenum'>[246]</span>
hurt him, se&ntilde;or gen'ral, an' him the best scrapper
o'the lot?"</p>

<p>"You must not. No, no! He is the father of
the lady."</p>

<p>"So that's it? And where's the fair lady?"
I asks.</p>

<p>"I know not. I trust she is on this ship, but
I know not. But have at 'em, as you say, se&ntilde;or
admiral, once more, and possibly we shall discover."</p>

<p>"All right, but let's have at 'em right," I says,
and down on the deck I throws my grand sword,
and with it the very fine scabbard which I'd been
holdin' with one hand to keep from givin' myself
the leg. And I sheds the gold-embroidered coat
on top of it. I kept wearin' the gold-mounted
shappo because the sun was hot, but the rest of
me was stripped to the waist. And I felt better,
and then I says: "Come on, gen'ral, unhook
that golden armor and be free an' easy in y'ur
motions like me."</p>

<p>"No, no, se&ntilde;or admiral. I shall wear my uniform,
even though it is to die in it," he answers
back.</p>

<p>"All right, se&ntilde;or gen'ral," I says, "have your
own way. It's the privilege of your rank, but
for me a little looser motions and a heavier armament,"
and I picks up what looks like a baseball
<span class='pagenum'>[247]</span>
bat, but a little longer and a little thicker
and a good deal heavier than any baseball bat.
A capstan-bar it was. And if y'ever handled one
you know what a great little persuader a capstan-bar
is. I could tell you a hundred stories o' capstan-bars.
Many a good fight used to be settled
in th' old sailin'-ship days with a capstan-bar.</p>

<p>And with my capstan-bar I haves at 'em right.
Soon I had two of the enemy backed up to the
forehatch, and before their worryin' eyes I flourishes
my capstan-bar. "Now then," I says, "it's
go below for you two or a pair of cracked skulls&mdash;which?"
And they went below, the pair of
them together like divin' seals, into what I see,
when I takes a peek, was mostly a cargo of pineapples
and cocoanuts in bulk. I could hear 'em
bouncin' around among 'em after they struck.</p>

<p>And now, being well warmed up to my work
and my head bustin' with strategy, I takes the
little captain in the rear and was about to lay
him low, when the gen'ral hollers: "Se&ntilde;or admiral,
you for-get&mdash;spare him!" So I spares him, but
I whales the other last one a couple in a soft
spot and chases him, till he took a high dive too
into the forehold; and I could also hear him
rattlin' and bouncin' around after he struck the
cocoanuts or the pineapples, whichever it was.
Then I goes for the little captain again, only
<span class='pagenum'>[248]</span>
now I picks him up and holds him while the gen'ral
ties his arms, and then, first clampin' down
the forehatches on the captured crew, we lowers
him into the cabin whilst we take a look around.</p>

<p>It was me for loot, the gen'ral for the fair lady.
But not a thing could I find, and him no fair
lady. In the hold, topside, between decks, everywhere;
but nothin' besides cocoanuts and other
fruit and some hogsheads o' rum. The rum was
an encouragin' item, but not what you'd call loot.
So we came back to the cabin and untied the
captain, who begins at once to go rollin' cigarettes
and shootin' green eyes at the pair of us.
The gen'ral takes a seat opposite him and argues
beseechin'ly, but not one soft look from the little
man.</p>

<p>The gen'ral, discouraged, turns to me. "Se&ntilde;or
admiral, what do you say for him? Is it not a
hard heart? I love his daughter, but he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She no lofe you!" snaps the little man.</p>

<p>"Ah-h, but how can you say that truly?" says
the gen'ral, and turns to me and says: "Is it not
just, se&ntilde;or admiral, that I should have one opportuni-ty
to see her?"</p>

<p>By this time I'd filled a little jug with some rum,
and there was lemons and brown sugar and a little
ice, and I thought 'twas kind o' rough on him,
and so I says: "Yes, I think y'oughter, 'specially
<span class='pagenum'>[249]</span>
while you got that uniform on. But where is
she?"</p>

<p>"Ah-h, that is it, where is she? On this ship
I have thought, but evident-ly not so."</p>

<p>"Maybe she's here at that, hidden somewhere,"
I says, "and if she is, believe me, gen'ral, I'll find
her," and leavin' a lemon swizzle to cool I begins
to search the schooner again. And this time I
takes a good look into the little captain's stateroom.
I didn't find the fair lady, but packed
cutely away under the old fellow's bunk was
about a cord o' money! Nothing less than a
thousand-dollar bill, but five and ten-thousand
dollar bills mostly, and all new. Lord knows how
much there was there, but I hauled a bushel or
so of it out on the cabin floor by way of a sample.
And the little man never stirred when he saw it;
and as for the gen'ral, "Bah!" he said&mdash;"Red
moneys!"</p>

<p>I was thinkin' I'd done a fine stroke, and that
made me feel kind o' put out. "I'll find that
girl if she's on the ship," I says then, and I steps
over to a corner of the cabin where there'd been
a fresh boarding-up of the bulkhead.</p>

<p>I gazes steady at it. And I could almost feel
the little man's eyes borin' into my back! And
I whirls around quick; there he was&mdash;paying no
attention to the gen'ral, but starin' at me. And
<span class='pagenum'>[250]</span>
to myself I says: "If losin' all that money in his
room don't jar him, it must be somethin' good
behind that bulkhead for him to worry over."
And with that in my mind I looks again at the
old fellow, and now I know what it is, and the
old man knew I knew, and into his eyes came
such a look that I stopped dead. You mustn't
forget that I was a big, loose, rangy 180-pounder,
and standin' there&mdash;I can see it now; I didn't
then&mdash;but me standin' there, with the heat of
warm exercise and three West Indian rum swizzles
oozing out of me on that tropic afternoon,
I c'n see now I wasn't any winged angel to look at.</p>

<p>But I had no notion of that then, only that I
was beginnin' to like the little captain; and with
that new feelin' I spoke to the gen'ral. "Here,"
I says, "let's step on deck for a minute." And
we went up, leaving the old fellow below with
his hands tied while we were gone. And up on
deck I says, quick and sharp: "Look here, mate,
what's this about you and the old chap's daughter?
Is it all straight?"</p>

<p>"Straight?" repeats the gen'ral, puzzled like.
"Straight? Ah-h&mdash;listen, my friend," and he
pours out on me what I wasn't huntin' for&mdash;his
autobie-ography. It was her father who had kept
them apart so. Her father, he did not love his&mdash;the
gen'ral's&mdash;father. An old family quarrel,
<span class='pagenum'>[251]</span>
yes. Oh, for a long time back. Politics. He
was of the Reds, her father, and his own father
of the Blues. Her uncle he had been vice-president
of the Red republic. It was true. But
why should he and the beautiful daughter suffer
for a quarrel which was so old, and the girl and
himself all that were left of both families? Why?
And I scratched my head and said I couldn't see
why either.</p>

<p>And love her! Before he got through I could
hear whole poems in the little wavelets lappin'
under our run, and in the evenin' breeze which
was kissin' my cheek. And the smell of oranges and
pineapples and molasses and good West India rum
coming up from the main hold&mdash;'twas the breath
of roses&mdash;only I stopped to hope the captured crew
in the forehold wasn't drinkin' up all the rum
in their end of the ship&mdash;and to this side and that
the lights of passin' ships were showin' and the
voices of men and women floatin' over the water,
darky voices mostly, and some were chorusin',
chorusin' a shanty air which I'd last heard from
a crowd of Georgia darkies loadin' a lumber
schooner, a four-masted lumber schooner, through
a great square hole in her bow from a railroad
dock on the Savannah River&mdash;one time, that was,
my ship put into Savannah and I got to know a
girl lived in the Yamacraw there, and on Sunday
<span class='pagenum'>[252]</span>
afternoons we used to walk up and sit on the
lumber piles on that same railroad wharf and
watch the yellow river flowing by and dream o'
things that never did happen an' never could&mdash;not
for her and me. And now, aboard the little
Caribbean trader, the moon was beginnin' to poke
over our starboard rail and the first little white
stars were peekin' out over the foretopsail, and
the gen'ral was still talking. And when he'd
done he laid his hand on my shoulder and said:
"Straight, my brave American friend? As straight
as a tall palm-tree. And all this"&mdash;he pulls on
the end of a couple of cords on his gold-mounted
coat&mdash;"I thought it would look well in her eyes."
And he stops.</p>

<p>"But you are of the North," he says after a
little while; "you think that foolish, possibly?"</p>

<p>"We do," I says. "We unanimously do," and
as I said it I got to thinkin' of how when I was
a boy I used to walk on my hands, and stand on
my head, and throw flip-flaps, or stop to knock
the head off some passin' kid&mdash;if I was able&mdash;anythin'
so a red-ginghamed, pop-eyed little girl
sittin' on the door-step across the street would
take notice. "We do those things when we are
boys," says I aloud.</p>

<p>"Ah-h! So you think&mdash;" says the gen'ral.
"Ver-ry good," and starts to throw off his uniform.
<span class='pagenum'>[253]</span></p>

<p>"No, no," I says. "Keep that on. It becomes
you. And, besides, I don't know's I'm so sure we
ought all to grow up. And come below&mdash;come!"
I thought I heard the old fellow's voice below and
I jumped down, and there he was, the little captain,
hurryin' away from the bulkhead.</p>

<p>And now I examines the bulkhead carefully,
and I goes up on deck and resumes my full admiral's
coat and buckles on the fine gold-mounted
belt and sword and sets my shappo just a little
to one side. I was wishin' I had my shoes, but
they were on the brigantine and she was a quarter-mile
away and still driftin'. And back in the
cabin again, I picks up the hammer and draws
from the bulkhead plankin' half a dozen nails,
and in two minutes it's done, and out under the
lights o' the cabin lamp steps&mdash;O, the prettiest,
slimmest little dark-eyed girl, just a match for
the gen'ral. But the first thing she sees is me,
Killorin. "Ah-h&mdash;" she says, in a long sigh with
her mouth a little open, and I tosses the hammer
and nails into a corner and straightens up and
takes a full breath; and let me tell you, son, in
those days the worst-lookin' flatfoot ever climbed
over a gunboat's side wasn't me, Killorin, bosun's
mate, second-class&mdash;or was I first-class then? No
matter; I was in a full-dress admiral's uniform
then, and from me cocked hat to me bare toes I
was some class. I knew I was&mdash;even without
<span class='pagenum'>[254]</span>
my shoes. And when again she looks at me and
when again she sighs, "Ah-h&mdash;" with her little
red lips apart, I says to myself: "Killorin, son,
you're makin' one big hit." And just then her
eyes looked past me and again she said, "Ah-h&mdash;"
and down among my lower ribs somewhere
dropped my quick-firm' heart, and "Killorin," I
whispers to myself, "she loves you&mdash;not." For
that last ah-h&mdash;and sigh-h for the gen'ral was
seven times deeper and longer than the one she
hove up at sight of me.</p>

<p>And while they were gazin' rapturous at each
other the little captain's eyes met mine. And
with a memory o' the last time I'd been up before
a summary court-martial, I takes charge of
the case. And "Sir," I says, "it appears to me
like I'd have to be judge here. You, sir, are a
prisoner o' war. And, to be more explicit, all
aboard here are prisoners o' war. But no gentleman,
and I say gentleman advisedly, is goin'
to include a woman in the loot without her own
consent, even if her father did hide her away and
deny the same, which is against all articles o' war,
besides bein' most disrespectful of service regulations.
But in consideration of your previous
good conduct we will not mention that now."</p>

<p>I turns to the gen'ral. "You, se&ntilde;or gen'ral,
do you believe me an honest man?" And without
<span class='pagenum'>[255]</span>
even lookin' at me he says, "Pff&mdash;a foolish
queschee-own, se&ntilde;or admiral. I have known you
are honest from the mo-ment I have seen you
spendin' your money foolishly at the hotel. And
brave&mdash;as all American sailormen are brave."</p>

<p>"Tis well," I says. "And you"&mdash;I turned to
the little captain&mdash;"you, I fear me, sir, will have
to take my honesty for granted. Now I'll be the
judge. Do you"&mdash;I faces the gen'ral again&mdash;"agree?
'Cause if you don't you an' me'll have
to hop up on deck and fight it out."</p>

<p>The gen'ral was still lookin' up at the little
captain's daughter. "Silence gives consent," I
says. "And now," I says, "it's the young lady
will say the word. Attend me, se&ntilde;orita. This
young man here, but two moments agone, up on
deck declared to me, while below the blue Caribbean
the sun like a fine ripe orange was sinkin',
and likewise the Southern Cross was shinin', lopsided,
like a blessin' in the southwest over toward
where the hills o' South America would 'a' been
if we could 'a' seen 'em&mdash;to me, on this occasion,
this young man declared he loved you. This
young man&mdash;attend me, and not him, fair lady,
please&mdash;and a gallant young man he is&mdash;I never
knew a gallanter on such short notice&mdash;this
young man on the occasion aforementioned declared
to me that he loves you and wants you to
<span class='pagenum'>[256]</span>
wife. What have you to say to this charge? Do
you love him or do you not? Take your time
in answerin'."</p>

<p>And I stood to one side. She was still lookin'
at the gen'ral and him at her. Just once she
looked at her father and once at me&mdash;and I
winked by way of encouragement&mdash;and she looked
at her gen'ral again, and looked and looked, till
all at once the gen'ral just nachally stepped across
the cabin floor and took her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Look here, boy," I says, stern-like, "ain't that
kind o' rushin' things? Have you a steady job&mdash;outside
o' privateerin'?"</p>

<p>"I do not work. I have money," he says over
her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Real money? Or this kind?" and I points to
the bales of new bills in the little captain's room.</p>

<p>"I have gold in the bank and much sugar
plantations."</p>

<p>"Then, orer pro nobis, she is yours," I says, and
waves my arms beneficent-like over the pair of
them. "And you and me," I says to the old
man, "as I don't see how we c'n help it, what
d'ye say if we two call the war off and have a
few lemon swizzles with ice in 'em?"</p>

<p>And I draws a jug o' Santiago rum, and there
was lemons an' sugar and a little ice, and we foregathers
like a couple of old shipmates after a foreign
<span class='pagenum'>[257]</span>
cruise. And when, in the mornin', from out
of the smooth Caribbean Sea the rosy sun came
swimmin' we was right there, joyous as a liberty
party on pay-day, to greet it. And the gen'ral
and the se&ntilde;orita also saluted the goddess o' the
mornin', and after breakfast we all went ashore,
and that night I danced a taranteller at the weddin'.
And, believe me, there's class to a good
taranteller dancer.</p>

<p>And likewise that night, with the silver moon
risin' like a goddess o' wisdom above the smooth
Caribbean, and me and the little captain mixin'
lemon swizzles on the veranda of the gen'ral's
plantation <i>hacienda</i>, the little captain says to
me: "I love you as one son. You shall be captain
of my ship." And as a sort of weddin' legacy
he bequeathes to me all the money was in the
schooner when the gen'ral and me captured her.</p>

<p>And next mornin' I took up my quarters on
the schooner, with the crews of the schooner and
the brigantine for body-servants. And I had
one good time. There was a basket there&mdash;a
basket about the size of a good-sized wash-basket&mdash;and
every mornin' I'd shovel a lot of money
into that. Oh, I don' know how much, maybe
two or three or four or five or six hundred thousand
dollars, and I'd say to the cook, or maybe
one of the deck force: "Here you, Fernando, go
<span class='pagenum'>[258]</span>
on up now an' hurry back." And they weren't
bad traders at all. In a couple of hours they'd
come hustling back with the full o' the basket o'
chickens, eggs, butter, cheese, bologny, and fruit&mdash;everything
a man 'd want for breakfast&mdash;in
place o' the money. Fifty thousand dollars a
day apiece I paid the crew, and good and plenty
for them&mdash;a lot o' lazy loafers. It used to take
three of 'em to buckle me into my uniform of a
hot morning.</p>

<p>I never knew how much money was in that
pile, but three or four, or maybe five or six hundred
million dollars. And maybe I didn't live
on the fat o' the land with it, for eight weeks! It
would 'a' lasted longer only it was the divil
tryin' to be thrifty with my admiral's uniform
on, and then one mornin' the <i>Hiawatha</i> came to
port, and with what I had left&mdash;forty or fifty
million, or whatever it was&mdash;I gave a farewell
party that night at the hotel where the banana
grove was in the yard. I wore my admiral's
uniform for the last time that night, and maybe
that made 'em charge me a little more, but no
matter that. In the mornin' I didn't have hardly
enough to tip the waiters, three or four hundred
thousand dollars, maybe, but&mdash;whatever it was, I
tips 'em with it, and goes down to the beach to
where the little, old, homely <i>Hiawatha</i> was laying
<span class='pagenum'>[259]</span>
to anchor, and 'twas eight o'clock and the
bugler was sounding colors and it made me feel
homesick, and I waves my hand back to the
town, and "Fare thee well, O Tangarine-a," I
says, "Tangarine-a, fare thee well." Secretary
o' the navy I could 'a' been, I know, but back
aboard the old <i>Hiawatha</i> I goes. And damn
glad, you betcher, I was to be there.</p>

<p>But an admiral of the Blue I was once, with
a hogshead of nothin' less than thousand-dollar
bills; and I helped to make two young people
happy. And no one c'n take that from me. And
so I say when people say there's no good in revolutions
you refer 'em to me, Killorin, bosun's mate,
U. S. N.&mdash;I'll tell 'em.</p>

<h2><a name="svend"
id="svend"></a>THE BATTLE-CRUISE
OF THE "SVEND FOYN"</h2>


<p>At this time I had drifted down South
America way, and was master of a combination
whaling and sealing steamer sailing out of
Punta 'renas for the firm of Amundsen &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Punta Arenas, if you don't happen to know, is
at the tip end of Patagonia, in the Magellan
Straits. It is now a highly respectable place under
the Chilean flag, but there was a time it wasn't.
All kinds of human wreckage used to drift onto
the west coast of South America in those days,
and when the Chilean Government couldn't take
care of them any other way they would ship them
down through the straits to Punta 'renas. At
the time I was there most of the bad ones had
been run out, but every now and then a few of
the old crew would pop up and worry people into
thinking Punta 'renas must still be a hard place,
which it wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. Amundsen lived in a big house up on the
plaza where the bandstand was, with a fine open-air
<span class='pagenum'>[264]</span>
veranda in front and a glassed-in conservatory
on the side, and aft of the house a garden with a
waterfall modelled after something he had left
behind him in Norway. He designed the waterfall
himself, and over the grandpiano in the front
room looking out on the plaza was an oil-painting
of it&mdash;a whale of a painting, done by a stranded
Scandinavian who told Mr. Amundsen he'd seen
that identical waterfall in Norway many a time,
which perhaps he had.</p>

<p>We didn't like Mr. Amundsen any the less because
of his collection of old sagas which he used
to spin out for hours on end. Whoppers, some
of them were, but we, his whaling and sealing
captains, we'd sit there and never let on, eating
thin Norwegian bread and goats' cheese and dried
chips of ptarmigan, with Trondhjem beer, and
none of us but would have sat longer any time,
so that after he got through there was a chance
to hear his daughter Hilda play the grandpiano&mdash;and
sing, maybe, while she played. And I tell
you, the thought of that fine old Norwegian and
Hilda after months of banging around to the west'ard
of Cape Horn in a little whaling steamer&mdash;it
was surely like coming home to be home-bound
then.</p>

<p>Norwegian songs were they, and I, American-born,
and only half Scandinavian by blood, was
<span class='pagenum'>[265]</span>
probably the one man coming to Amundsen's who
didn't know every word of them by heart. But
not much of the sentiment of them I missed at
that, because in other days I'd cruised off Norway,
too, and knew the places the songs told
about&mdash;the high-running fjords and the little
white lighthouses; the fish drying on the rocks
and the night sun floating just above the edge of
the gray sea; and, again, the long black night of
winter and the dead piled up to wait till they
could be buried when the snow went in the spring.</p>

<p>But shore time in Punta 'renas was holiday
time. Wet days, hard days at sea have their
time, too; and Mr. Amundsen and Hilda and
Punta 'renas were a long way behind me. I was
whaling and sealing in the South Pacific, and had
been doing pretty well, but nothing record-breaking
till one day I picked up a lot of ambergris.</p>

<p>Now I could have stocked a million dollars in a
regular way and nobody pay any great attention;
but the tale of that find went through half the
South Pacific. A dozen whaling and sealing masters
boarded me in one month to see if it was so,
and after I'd told them the story of it about
forty-five times, I began to see myself telling it
to old Amundsen and Hilda in the big front room
looking out on the plaza, her father and I having
a late supper of flat bread and the goats' cheese
<span class='pagenum'>[266]</span>
and the dried ptarmigan chips, with Trondhjem
beer, and Hilda playing softly on the piano with
an eye and an ear maybe sidewise now and again
to me.</p>

<p>And now we were truly homeward bound in old
Magellan Straits, with the hills back of Punta
'renas in sight from our masthead, when we spied
a Norwegian bark with a deckload of lumber
ashore on the spit of Pouvenir Bay, which is on
the southerly&mdash;the Terra del Fuego&mdash;shore of the
straits. Her ensign was upside down in her rigging,
and I headed in to see if we could help her
out. I thought it was queer no one showed up
aboard her to answer when I hailed, but no matter&mdash;I
moored my steamer just inside the spit
and put off with half a dozen men in a boat and
went aboard.</p>

<p>Nobody on her deck, nobody in her below for-'ard.
I went aft and dropped into her cabin, my
men behind me, and we were peeking here and
there to see what it was could be wrong, when
slap! on goes the cabin hatch over our heads.
Then we hear the padlock slipped on and the
lock sprung. We are prisoners, without even a
peek at who it was did it.</p>

<p>We heard them going off. Without waiting
any longer, I began slashing away with my pocket-knife,
the only knife among us, and by and by I
<span class='pagenum'>[267]</span>
had cut our way through the cabin door; but that
took a lot of time. From the bark's deck, when
we were clear, there was nothing in sight except
our own steamer to anchor in the bay beyond the
spit. The boat we had come in was gone.</p>

<p>Well, we weren't worrying about the boat, only
we had to take the time to lash together twenty
or thirty pine planks and some scantling from
the bark's deckload of lumber and raft ourselves
around the spit and into the little bay to get to
our steamer. Everything about her looked all
right, except that none of the crew were in sight
when we paddled alongside. I hurried over the
rail to see what was the matter. It didn't take
long to see. The hatches were off her hold and
our sealskins and our ambergris gone from below.
A fortune it was, gone&mdash;s-st!&mdash;like that.</p>

<p>Looking further, we found the rest of the crew
nicely locked up in the fo'c's'le. They didn't
know what happened, except that some men had
come rowing in from the direction of the lumber
bark in our boat, and one of them had sung out in
English and another in Norwegian that they were
the crew of the bark, with a message from me.</p>

<p>My crew, of course, said: "Come aboard." But
no sooner aboard than the strangers out with
revolvers, back my men into the fo'c's'le, and lock
them in. That was all they knew about that,
<span class='pagenum'>[268]</span>
except they heard the noise of the hurrying of
our cargo out of the hold, and then the sound of
a steamer making fast alongside and of shifting
our cargo to her deck and of her moving away.
And then all quiet till we came back.</p>

<p>Well, whoever did it must have had us timed
pretty well. They must have had a gang hid in
the lumber bark and a steamer hid somewhere in
the straits near by waiting for us. It looked as
if there was nothing for us to do but take our
loss and keep on for Punta 'renas, but first I went
to the masthead and had a look out.</p>

<p>Opposite Pouvenir Bay the Straits of Magellan
are at their widest. From the crow's-nest there
was a good stretch of sea to look at. To the
west'ard was a touch of smoke, which might be
the steamer which looted us; surely she didn't
go to the east'ard, for there it was open water
with nothing in sight. To the northward, toward
Patagonia, of course, she would not go, because
Punta 'renas was there. But I had a look that
way, and as I looked I could see what looked like
an open boat heading our way; and I wondered
who she would be and what she would be after
in a place like Terra del Fuego.</p>

<p>They came skipping on at a great clip for an
open boat. They were running her to a long
main-sheet, but keeping a tight hand on the sheet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="illo268" id="illo268"></a>
<img src="images/illo_p268.jpg" width="400" height="583" alt="The strangers

<span class="caption">The strangers out with revolvers, back my men into
the fo&#39;c&#39;s&#39;le, and lock them in.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[269]</span>
As they drew nearer I see she was white-painted,
and pretty soon I see she was too big to be anything
but a navy sailing cutter, and soon again
I made out that they were a crew of American
naval officers and bluejackets.</p>

<p>They went out of their way some to sweep
under the stern of the bark, and I noticed they
all took a look up at her and back at her, wondering,
as I thought, how she came to go ashore.
They held on for the inside of the bay and ran
straight up onto a little reach of pebbly beach;
and no sooner grounded than most of them went
tearing across the spit with rifles and shotguns.
I see what they were now&mdash;it was a hunting party.</p>

<p>Without wasting a second they began to blaze
away at the wild ducks as they came swooping
down from the west. In that country the wild
game don't know what a man looks like, and as
it was late in the afternoon, with the ducks coming
back for the night from the west'ard, the
shooting was good. Swooping along the shore
they came, across the mouth of the bay, flock
after flock so close-set and low-lying that they
didn't need guns. They could have sat on the
beach and hove up stones or drift-wood and killed
'em as they went kiting by, sixty miles or more
an hour to the east'ard.</p>

<p>After twenty minutes or so they must have
<span class='pagenum'>[270]</span>
thought that kind of shooting was too easy, for
part of them went off into the brush and the
others came back to the spit of beach and, with
some kindlings from their boat and some drift-wood
and brush, started a fire. It was a north
wind, and I could smell the ducks cooking and
the coffee making, and I couldn't hold off any
longer. I rowed myself over in our second boat.
The senior line officer of the party, a lieutenant,
invited me to join them, which I did, and pretty
soon I was eating broiled duck and drinking real
American coffee, with bacon and eggs, and forgetting
my troubles.</p>

<p>After supper we sat around and talked, and
they told me what had happened to the lumber
bark. She had been lured inshore by false lights
the night before and boarded by a gang under
Red Dick, who had cleaned her out of stores and
what money they had, and had driven the crew
off in the morning after beating up most of them
by way of diverting himself. Then the bark's
captain and his crew rowed across the Straits of
Punta Arenas in their quarter-boat, looking for
satisfaction. Nobody there could do anything
for them, because nothing less than a war-ship
could have overcome Red Dick, and there was
no Chilean war-ship nearer than Valparaiso, and
that was six days' steaming away.
<span class='pagenum'>[271]</span></p>

<p>"But how did that lumber captain know it
was Red Dick?" I asked at this point.</p>

<p>"He didn't know," answered the officer who'd
been talking. "But when he described him everybody
in Punta Arenas said it was Red Dick. But
aren't you an American?"</p>

<p>I said I was and told them my experience, and
they all said what a pity my ship wasn't under
the American flag so they could put it up to their
captain and be sure he would send a party after
Red Dick. And they would all like nothing better
than to join that party, and an easy matter
all 'round, as their ship was to be hanging around
the straits for another week.</p>

<p>By this time the others of the party, who'd
gone into the brush for wild geese, were coming
back. They didn't get any geese, because geese,
wild geese, anyway, aren't near so foolish as a
lot of people think. They were hungry and sat
right down to supper.</p>

<p>Among them, as I looked, was one I knew for
Peter Lawson, an old shipmate. A warrant officer
I saw he was now, but when I knew him
he was a chief carpenter's mate on the old <i>Missalama</i>.
We kept eying each other, and by and by
he remembered, and we stood up and shook hands
across the fire. In half a minute we were talking
of old days in the navy.
<span class='pagenum'>[272]</span></p>

<p>By this time it was late day, with the sun
going down below the hills on the other side of
Pouvenir Bay. I remember it went down red as
the heart of the fire we were sitting by. Through
the little thin whiffs of the smoke of the fire it
looked like that&mdash;all hot color and no flame.
Nothing to that, of course, only pictures like that
do start your brain to going. The little bay was
there at our feet and the wide straits off to our elbow,
and the water of that bay was smooth green
where it shoaled on the pebbly spit; but the straits,
as far as we could see them, were one long roll
of tossing ridges and scooping hollows, and they
were all black except where the williwaws, cutting
across the tide, would whip the ridges to a marble
white.</p>

<p>I saw the sun set red through the thin blue
smoke of the fire, and almost in line with the sun
and the smoke was the stranded bark with her
deckload of lumber. A little farther off was my
own little <i>Svend Foyn</i>. It was coming on dark
by then and I could see them making ready the
anchor light on the <i>Svend Foyn</i>. And it was
coming colder, too, for the broad, warm north
wind had changed to a thin little icy wind from
the south.</p>

<p>And now the fiery-red reflection of the sun was
gone from above the hills across the bay, and when
<span class='pagenum'>[273]</span>
that went all warmth went with it. Everybody
drew nearer to the fire except the two apprentice
boys, who were cleaning up the mess gear in
water made hot at a little fire of their own. One
of them was singing to himself little jiggly, ragtime
songs while he wiped the dishes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Oh-h, ahm gwine down to Macon town<br /></span>
<span>Ter buy mah 'Liza Jane a gown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Ah feel so happy 'n' ah don' know why,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mah bai-bie, mah hon-ie!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Every time he stacked up a few plates he would
stop to roll a few more cake-walk steps.</p>

<p>"I wish I was feeling as good as you!" I said
to myself while I watched him.</p>

<p>And, watching him, I got to thinking of Hilda
in the big front room in what was home for me&mdash;and
of having to tell her what a failure my cruise
had been. It did set me to thinking.</p>

<p>All at once it came to me, and "I've got it!"
I said, not knowing I said it out loud until I saw
that everybody around the fire was looking at
me; and at last Peter said, "What's it you got?"</p>

<p>And I told them what I had in mind, and they
all thought it was a great scheme&mdash;if I could
carry it out. And the lieutenant in charge of the
party said: "And we'll help you; but not to-night&mdash;the
first thing in the morning after a good
night's sleep."
<span class='pagenum'>[274]</span></p>

<p>We had a good sleep that night, sleeping till
sunrise on the pebbly beach with the mainsail
of the sailing cutter for a tent over us. And in
the morning the first thing after breakfast I pulled
the lumber bark off the beach and moored her in
the bay. That was so she wouldn't break up
and go to pieces the first gale of wind came along;
and, as after that service I figured her owners
wouldn't call it stealing, I helped myself to a few
thousand feet of lumber off her deck, and we all
set to work to make the <i>Svend Foyn</i> over into
what her builder back in Norway certainly never
intended her for.</p>

<p>First, we built up her topsides to make a superstructure,
and then added the other things a first-class
battle-ship ought to have. The <i>Svend Foyn</i>
had two masts and one smoke-stack. The two
masts were all right. We had only to set fighting-tops
around them, but she would be a poor
class of a battle-ship with only one smoke-stack.
So we gave her two more. We painted her lower
sides white and her topsides yellow-brown, and
for turrets we had one to each end with what was
intended for 12-inch gun muzzles sticking out of
them. And we allowed the ends of what looked
like twelve 7-inch black boys to peek through
the sides of what we called her gun-deck. Two
of those 7-inch muzzles were real muzzles, that is,
<span class='pagenum'>[275]</span>
black-tarred wood like the others, but they were
hollow so we could train a bomb-lance whaling-gun
through them, one to each side. When we
got that far they said I would have to name her,
and I called her the <i>Cape Horn</i>, and there being
no flag that any of us had ever heard of for Terra
del Fuego, we made one for her out of three
pieces of green, red, and purple cloth, and broke
it out to her main-peak.</p>

<p>And when that little round-bowed, fat-sterned
whaler waddled out of Pouvenir Bay that afternoon
there wasn't a thing that one lieutenant,
one ensign, one doctor, a warrant carpenter, and
sixteen enlisted men of the United States Navy
could see she was shy of, except a wireless outfit,
and we soon fixed that by stringing a stretch of
old wire between her masts, with half a dozen old
barrel hoops for a wireless plant, and for fear
there was anybody of Red Dick's party who knew
battle-ships only from pictures, I had the stokers
keep feeding her fires with whale-oil. After that,
with the clouds of smoke belching out of her, I
felt sure nobody could doubt us&mdash;especially at a
distance.</p>

<p>We gave three whistles and dipped the ensign
to our navy friends, and for the rest of that day
and night, and all next day and night, we steamed
through the straits toward the Pacific. And on
<span class='pagenum'>[276]</span>
the second morning we turned north and ran in
among the islands off the Chilean coast; and
pretty soon we ran into the place I was bound
for&mdash;a bottle-shaped passage with a narrow inlet
to each end and the shadow of the Andes Mountains
darkening all. And, laying to moorings there,
was a cargo steamer of perhaps fifteen hundred
tons. Even if she wasn't too big a steamer to be
loafing there, I knew her of old. Red Dick was
handy. I took a look around to the north'ard,
and at the other end of the passage and jam in
to the high rocks was a whaling steamer about
our own tonnage. I also knew her of old.</p>

<p>I might as well say now that Red Dick and I
weren't strangers. We used to be sort of friends,
but not since the day we walked up the long
timber pier in Punta 'renas together and met
Hilda with her father. She was straight from
school in Norway then, and 'twas the first time
we'd seen her. We looked out together on the
wonderful straits, and 'twas me she walked home
with.</p>

<p>But that was a year back, and it was other
business now. I had now to make an impression,
and right away, to back up our battle-ship looks.
So we cut loose and gave them, port and starboard,
one after the other, twenty-one whaling
bombs in good, regulation style. They made
a terrible racket against the Andes Mountains,
which come down here to the water's edge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="illo276" id="illo276"></a>
<img src="images/illo_p276.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="&#39;Twas me she walked home with." title="&#39;Twas me she walked home with" />
<span class="caption">&#39;Twas me she walked home with.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[277]</span>
And Red Dick's gang must have thought we
were some awful power, for there was soon great
doings on the deck of the whaling steamer. Smoke
began to come out of her, and pretty soon she
began to move; but when we bore down, with a
great white wave ahead of us and rolls of smoke
over us, they quit. Two boats dropped over her
side and headed for a bit of beach, and twenty
men scurried off and lost themselves in holes between
the rocks. We shot a few bombs over
their heads just to let them know we were a rich
nation with ammunition to spare. The echoes
coming back sounded like a battle-fleet saluting
port in foreign waters.</p>

<p>We boarded Red Dick's steamer, and there
were our sealskins and ambergris. There were
also four or five thousand other fine sealskins
which weren't ours, but which we took along,
knowing they weren't Red Dick's. And with
Red Dick's steamer in charge of six of my crew
behind us, we started back the way we came.
In steaming past the cargo steamer we counted
four long glasses levelled at us.</p>

<p>The first likely place we came to we hauled to
and shifted Red Dick's cargo to the <i>Svend Foyn</i>.
By this time, with the ambergris back and five
<span class='pagenum'>[278]</span>
thousand extra sealskins below, all hands were
willing to take a moderate chance on almost anything.
We swung away for the straits, but not
making great headway. The little old <i>Svend Foyn</i>
was never any wonder for steaming. At her best
she could do perhaps ten miles an hour. Now,
with all her battle-ship topgear and with the wind
ahead, she was doing perhaps six.</p>

<p>It began to breeze up, but nothing for us to
worry over until we saw a steamer's smoke coming
up astern. We were then clear of the coast islands
and into the straits, with wind and sea fighting
each other.</p>

<p>I had another good look at the steamer coming
up astern, and took my prize crew off Red Dick's
whaler and turned her adrift. I hated to. Not
alone the prize money, but to see a good ship go
to loss any time is bad. I did it in hopes that
the cargo steamer coming upon us would stop to
get her, and while they were getting her&mdash;what
with the gale and the dark coming&mdash;we would be
able to slip away. But they didn't stop. Perhaps
the little whaler was too close in to the cliffs
for the big steamer to have a chance in the tide
that was running. They let her pile up against
the cliffs, and came on and ranged up abreast of
us. Red Dick was on her bridge. She came so
close to us that I could almost have jumped
<span class='pagenum'>[279]</span>
aboard. It was blowing pretty hard at the time,
but she was making easy weather of it&mdash;a good
sea-boat. We weren't. The williwaws, which
are what they call the hard squalls off the high
hills down there, were having a great time with
out battle-ship topsides. She was something of a
roller on her own account at any time, the <i>Svend
Foyn</i>, but now she rolled her wooden turrets under
and every once in a while her bridge.</p>

<p>Red Dick leaned over the bridge rail and laughed.
He looked the <i>Svend Foyn's</i> top gear over and
laughed again. "Blank shells and wooden guns!"
he called out. "Fine! Any more left?"</p>

<p>"Oh," I said, "not all blanks and not all
wooden, and a few left&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"So?" he says, and gives an order. A man
pulls a tarpaulin off a long needle-gun amidships.
"Got anything like that in your battery?" he
calls out.</p>

<p>I looked it over as if I was interested. At the
same time I made a sign to my mate behind me.
I'd long before this loaded my two whaling bomb-lance
guns, but this time I put in them the lances,
which were of steel, weighed eighty pounds, and
were four and a half feet long&mdash;not a bad little
projectile at all.</p>

<p>"What's it for?" I called out, pointing to his
needle-gun.
<span class='pagenum'>[280]</span></p>

<p>"What's it for?" he mimics. "What d'y'
think it's for?"</p>

<p>I shake my head. "I could never guess."</p>

<p>"Well, you will soon. You know me?"</p>

<p>"I do. And you know me?"</p>

<p>"I know you, and I'll take no chances with you.
I'm going to heave you a line and take you in
tow."</p>

<p>"I don't remember flying any signals for a tow."</p>

<p>"No? Well, I think you'd be better off for a
tow. Take my line."</p>

<p>"We don't want your line."</p>

<p>"Take my line or I'll blow a few holes in you,
and while you're on your way to the bottom of
the straits&mdash;all hands of you&mdash;I'll ram you to
make sure."</p>

<p>"You're foolish to sink us," I says, "till you
take off the ambergris and the sealskins."</p>

<p>He began to get mad. "Take my line or take
a shell from this gun. Which is it?" he yells.</p>

<p>His gun was trained on our midship topsides.
I couldn't see where he was going to sink us,
leastwise not with one shot, so, "Come aboard
with your shell!" I called out, and he did. I
didn't look to see what damage the shell did in
passing, but it went clear through our pine topsides
one side and out the other.</p>

<p>I'd already passed the word to my mate, and
<span class='pagenum'>[281]</span>
wh-r-oo! went the four-and-a-half-foot bomb-lance
from the inside of one of our make-believe seven-inch
rifles. The lance tore through just above
the water-line of Red Dick's steamer. The bomb
exploded inside her hull. Through the hold the
sea rushed, and from her deck below came whoops
of surprise.</p>

<p>I rolled the little fat <i>Svend Foyn</i> around. She
near capsized in turning, especially as Red Dick
let me have two more from his needle-gun while
we were coming around. One of them burst inside,
but didn't kill anybody. Around came the
<i>Svend Foyn</i>.</p>

<p>"Her water-line!" I yelled, and we let her have
it. And again we gave it to her. They both
went home.</p>

<p>Red Dick quit laughing. He ran down from
the bridge and out of sight below. Pretty soon,
through her sides, as we hear him and his gang
yelling, came the ends of blankets and mattresses,
to keep the sea out of the holes we'd made.</p>

<p>And while they are at that we give them another.
And that settled it. Five minutes before,
I had an idea we might have to go to the bottom&mdash;s-sst!
like that. And now Red Dick and his
cargo steamer were belting through the tide rips
toward the Terra del Fuego shore, to find a bay,
I suppose, and a bit of a beach to haul up and
<span class='pagenum'>[282]</span>
patch things. And I couldn't help thinking as he
went that he'd lost a desperate reputation about
as easy as any ever I heard of; but I might as
well also say now that I'd been shipmates with
Red Dick, and I always did believe he was a
good deal of a bluff. But my crew didn't think
that. There was great rejoicing among them, and
I let them rejoice so long as they didn't stop setting
things to rights.</p>

<p>We were shook up some&mdash;our bridge loosened
up, our wireless hoops hanging droopy, our two
fake smoke-stacks lying over on their sides, and
the for'ard turret with some dents in it; but
bow first, and in peace and quiet, we steamed on.
And we were still steaming in peace and quiet
when we made Punta Arenas.</p>

<p>And, steaming in, I thought I might as well do
it in style. Here we were, a victorious battle-ship
entering a foreign port, and so I hoisted our
international code&mdash;spelling it out that we were
the <i>Cape Horn</i> of the Terra del Fuegan navy, and
asking permission to anchor. The captain of the
American battle-ship was standing on his bridge
as we steamed down the line, with a man in our
chains heaving the lead, my mate on the fore-bridge
and myself on the after-bridge, a quartermaster
to the wheel, and the second mate spying,
busy as could be, through a long glass; and not
<span class='pagenum'>[283]</span>
alone the captain, but the nine hundred and odd
officers and men of the American battle-ship roared
in review of us. The other ships in port didn't
know what to make of it no way.</p>

<p>We came around and dropped our young anchor,
splash! and saluted the port&mdash;twenty-one
guns from our bomb-lance things.</p>

<p>Our lieutenant of the hunting party seemed to
be officer of the deck on the real battle-ship.
"How'd you come out?" he hails.</p>

<p>"We met the enemy and their loot is ours,"
I answers.</p>

<p>"Captain Fenton presents his compliments and
would like to have you come aboard," he hails.</p>

<p>And I went aboard, sitting in the stern-sheets
of my second boat, with the red, green, and purple
flag trailing astern and eight men to the oars.
And they gave me two bosun's pipes with four
side-boys and two long ruffles from the drums as
I came over the side, and in the captain's cabin
I told him what the officers of the hunting party
couldn't tell him already. And he thought it the
best story he'd heard in a long time.</p>

<p>I thought it was a pretty good story myself,
and told it again to Mr. Amundsen on the same
long pier where I had first met him with Hilda,
and he said the blood of the old vikings must be
in my veins, and uncorked four solid hours of the
<span class='pagenum'>[284]</span>
old sagas, finishing up in the big front room with
fiat bread and goats' cheese and dried ptarmigan
chips and Trondhjem beer.</p>

<p>By and by I got a chance to tell it to Hilda&mdash;that
and a little more while I was telling it.
The band, a fine band, too, was playing their
Sunday-night concert out in the plaza. I remember
how the music made pictures in my brain
while I talked, though I never could remember
what they played.</p>

<p>However, that's no matter. Hilda says I told
the story right that night. And I've told it many
a time since&mdash;to her and the children when I'm
home from sea. They are good children, who believe
everything that is told them&mdash;even the sagas
of their grandfather.</p>

<h2><a name="passenger" id="passenger"></a>THE LAST PASSENGER</h2>



<p>Meade was having his coffee in the smoking-room.
Major Crupp came in and
took a seat beside him.</p>

<p>A watchful steward hurried over. "Coffee,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>"Cigarette, Major?" asked Meade.</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;thanks."</p>

<p>Lavis came in. Both men passed the greetings
of the evening with him, and then Meade, at
least, forgot that he existed. Only interesting
people were of value to Meade, and he had early
in the passage appraised Lavis&mdash;one of those
negligible persons whose habit was to hover near
some group of notables and look at them or listen
to them, and, if encouraged, join in the conversation,
or, if invited, take a hand in a game
of cards.</p>

<p>"Seen Cadogan since dinner, Major?" asked
Meade.</p>

<p>"He's patrolling the deck right now."</p>

<p>"With the beautiful lady?"
<span class='pagenum'>[288]</span></p>

<p>"Nope&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>"Thank God! And where is she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's nicely enthroned, thank you, in an
angle of the loungeroom with that sixty-millionaire
coal baron, Drissler."</p>

<p>"It's bath-tubs, and he's only got twenty millions."</p>

<p>"The poor beggar! Well, Meade, if ever she
gets within shelling distance of his little twenty
millions they'll melt like a dobey house in the
rain."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that, I guess. And yet&mdash;and yet
up to late this afternoon, at least, she appeared
to be delighting in the presence of Cadogan."</p>

<p>"She surely did. But"&mdash;Major Crupp eyed
Meade quizzically&mdash;"what are you worrying
about?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid she hasn't really shook him. I
know too much about her. The twenty millions
would be nice to draw upon, but her one unquenchable
passion is man, and in build, looks,
age, and temperament Cadogan is just one rich
prize. But how do you account for Cadogan?
He's certainly bright enough in other matters."</p>

<p>Crupp projected three smoke rings across the
table at Meade. "I was stationed in the wilds
of the Philippines one time. The native women
where I was were unwashed, bow-legged, black
<span class='pagenum'>[289]</span>
creatures about four feet high. After three years
of it I returned home in a government transport.
I landed in San Francisco. At first I thought it
was a dream."</p>

<p>"Thought what was a dream, Major?"</p>

"The women going by. I posted myself on
the corner of two streets, and there I stood transfixed,
except every ten minutes or so, when I'd
run into the hotel bar behind me and have another
drink. And I'd come out again, and I'd
take another look at those big, beautiful, upstanding
creatures floating by, hosts and hosts of
'em, and I'd whisper to myself: 'Cruppie, you're
dead. You've been boloed on outpost and gone
to heaven, and you don't know it.' And googoo-eyed
I kept staring at 'em, investing every last
one of 'em with a double halo, till a long, splayfooted,
thin-necked hombre in a policeman's uniform
came along and says: 'Here, you, I've been
pipin' you off for about four hours now. About
time you moved on, ain't it?' Lord, and not one
of 'em that couldn't have married me on the
<p>spot, I held 'em in such respect."</p>

<p>"Thick, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"I thought so&mdash;then. But I wonder if Caddie
would think we were thick, too, if we told him
to move on? He's just back, remember, from
two years in the jungle, and her eyes haven't
<span class='pagenum'>[290]</span>
changed color and her hair still shines like a new
gold shoulder-knot at dress parade. She is still
beautiful&mdash;and clever."</p>

<p>"Clever? She's surely that; but he's only a
boy, Major."</p>

<p>"M-m&mdash;twenty-six!"</p>

<p>"What's twenty-six? He's still a dreaming boy.
I'd like to say what I really thought of her."</p>

<p>"Don't. They'd be having a squad of stewards
in here to police the place after you got
through."</p>

<p>"Why don't you give him a hint?"</p>

<p>"Huh! No, no, Mister Meade&mdash;I'm still young
and fair. You break it to him. Who knows,
your age may save you from being projected
through the nearest embrasure!" Crupp crushed
the smoking end of his cigarette against the ash-tray.
"I'll have to run along now."</p>

<p>"Back soon?"</p>

<p>"After I've said good night to two or three
dear old ladies in the loungeroom before they
go below."</p>

<p>"And two or three dear young ladies who
won't be going below."</p>

<p>"Don't be saucy, Meade. You look out of
uniform when you try to be saucy. Exactness
as to fact and luminosity of language&mdash;that's
you, if you please."
<span class='pagenum'>[291]</span></p>

<p>"Bring Vogel on your way back."</p>

<p>"If I can detach him from his beloved maps.
Forty millions in railroads he's got now. And
colored maps of 'em he's got. He gloats over
'em&mdash;- gloats, every night before he turns in."</p>

<p>"Hurry him up, anyway. And drive Cadogan
in. I'll get him going on a few adventures,
and make him forget his beautiful lady."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lavis had been sitting on the transom. He
always seemed to be sitting on the transom&mdash;a
long, lean, huddled-up figure in the corner, looking
out with half-closed eyes on the life of the
smoking-room.</p>

<p>Cadogan came in. Meade revolved the chair
next to him at the table, so that Cadogan had
only to fall into it. Cadogan abstractedly nodded
his thanks. Catching sight of Lavis, he nodded
and smiled.</p>

<p>With eyes staring absently into space Cadogan
was drumming on the table with his fingers.</p>

<p>"Sounds like some tom-tom march you're trying
to play," interrupted Meade, and proffered a
cigar. Cadogan shook his head.</p>

<p>"No?" Meade dropped his cigar placidly back
into its case. "But listen here, Cadogan. As a
writer and newspaper man, my main business in
life is to discover people who know more than
<span class='pagenum'>[292]</span>
other people about some particular thing, and
then get it out of them. What about this ocean-liner
travelling of to-day&mdash;is it perfectly safe?"</p>

<p>"The safest mode of travel ever devised&mdash;or
should be."</p>

<p>"But lives are lost?"</p>

<p>"Surely. And probably will be. But they
should not be&mdash;not on the high sea&mdash;except in a
collision, and then probably one ship or the other
is to blame. Even inshore, if they keep their
lead and foghorn going, and steam up to kick
her off, nothing will happen either, unless"&mdash;he
shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"they've gone foolish or
something else on the bridge."</p>

<p>Meade questioned further. And Cadogan answered
briefly, abstractedly, until&mdash;Meade growing
more cunning and subtle&mdash;he was led into
citing one experience after another from out of
his own life in proof of this or that side of an
argument.</p>

<p>Cadogan had begun in short, snappy sentences,
and in a tense, rather high-keyed voice; but once
warmed up he swung along in rounded, almost
classic periods; and his voice deepened and softened
and, as he became yet more absorbed in his
subject, grew rhythmical, musical almost, the
while his words took on added color and glow.</p>

<p>Once in full swing it was not difficult for Meade
<span class='pagenum'>[293]</span>
to get him to run on; and he ran on for an hour,
and would have gone on indefinitely only, suddenly
coming to himself and looking around, he
discovered that half the room had gathered in a
semicircle behind his chair. He flushed, cut his
story short, and said no more. The crowd dispersed
to their various seats.</p>

<p>Presently Meade observed: "How did you
ever find time in your young life for the half of
it? And how you do suggest things&mdash;possibilities
that try a man's spirit even to contemplate!"</p>

<p>Cadogan did not respond; but from Lavis, the
man on the transom, came: "And now you are
suggesting the really great adventuring!"</p>

<p>Meade turned in surprise. "What is that?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it in the spirit we have the really great
adventures?"</p>

<p>Meade studied him curiously. "You mean
that the most thrilling adventures are those we
only dream about, but which never happen?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean exactly that, for they do happen.
What I meant was that to try your body
was nothing, but to try your soul&mdash;try it to the
utmost&mdash;there would be something."</p>

<p>"To risk it or try it?" asked Meade.</p>

<p>"Oh, to try it only. To risk it, would not that
be sinful?"</p>

<p>Cadogan's instinctive liking for Lavis had led
<span class='pagenum'>[294]</span>
him from the beginning of the voyage to take a
keen interest in whatever he might do or say;
but until to-night he had found him a most unobtrusive
and taciturn man. He had a feeling that
this man, who before to-night had barely said
more than good morning and good night to him,
understood him much better than did Meade, the
professional observer, who was forever questioning
him. The answer to Meade's last question
stirred him particularly, because he felt that it
was meant, not for Meade, but for himself.</p>

<p>Thinking of Meade, who was a famous author
and journalist, Cadogan said hesitatingly and
shyly: "I've often thought I'd like to be a writer."
He meant that for Lavis, but it was Meade who
took it to himself to ask him why.</p>

<p>"If I were a writer, I'd have hope right now
of taking part in one of the greatest adventures
that could befall a man."</p>

<p>"Where, Cadogan?"</p>

<p>"Right aboard this ship. How? Here we are
tearing through the iceberg country trying to
make a record. If ever we piled up head on to
one of those icebergs, where would we be?"</p>

<p>"But it is a clear night. And the lookouts."</p>

<p>"Never mind the clear night&mdash;or the lookouts
if they are not looking out."</p>

<p>"But this ship can't sink."
<span class='pagenum'>[295]</span></p>

<p>"No? But suppose she can sink, and that
she is sinking. There are four thousand people
aboard&mdash;and down she goes. Wouldn't that be
an experience?"</p>

<p>With meditative eyes directed down to the
ashes at the end of his cigar, Meade mulled over
the question. "A great adventure it surely would
be," he at length emitted from behind a puff of
smoke. "The right man, a great writer, for instance,
if he could live through that, would make
a world's epic of it."</p>

<p>Cadogan wondered what the man on the transom
was thinking of. He put his next question
directly to him. "There would be some great
deaths in such an event, don't you think, sir?"
His own eyes were glowing.</p>

<p>"Some great deaths, surely&mdash;and some horrible
ones, doubtless, too."</p>

<p>"Oh, but men would die like gods at such a
time!"</p>

<p>"No doubt&mdash;and like dogs also."</p>

<p>Meade did not relish losing control of the conversation
to an undistinguished outsider. "Look
here, Cadogan," he interjected; "could a man live
through that&mdash;go down with the ship and survive?"</p>

<p>"He could survive the sinking&mdash;yes; but he
would not live long&mdash;not in water near icebergs.
<span class='pagenum'>[296]</span>
The numbness soon creeps up to your heart, and
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But how could a man do it and live?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir, do you insist that he should live?"
It was Lavis who had spoken.</p>

<p>Meade's eyebrows rose above the tops of his
horn glasses. "Eh!" Cadogan, too, stared at
Lavis.</p>

<p>"To live after it would be only to half complete
the adventure. We began by speaking of
an adventure in the spirit. To make a real, a
great adventure of it, should not the man die?"</p>

<p>Meade now smiled with obvious tolerance.
"But a man dead and buried in the depths of
the sea!"</p>

<p>"That would only be his body, and we were
speaking of an adventure of the spirit&mdash;of the
soul. The man should experience every physical
dread, every nervous fear, every emotional horror
of those last few minutes, share the bitterness of
the disillusionment inevitable when three or four
thousand ordinary, every-day human beings are
dying in despair, because, as they would judge
it, dying so needlessly. To get the full measure
of it, and to share also in the sweetness and resignation
of great souls in the hour of death, would
not his mortal body have to meet death, even as
the others?"
<span class='pagenum'>[297]</span></p>

<p>Meade readjusted his horned spectacles. He
would have to revise his notes of the man, that
was plain. Forty, or forty-five possibly, he was.
Tall and large-framed, but spare, thin-cheeked,
and hollow-templed, with white streaks among
the close-clipped, very black, and very thick hair
which showed from under his cap. A worn-looking
man, a student. M-m&mdash;he had him
now&mdash;a teacher of the classics in some college,
possibly a young women's college.</p>

<p>"To get back to our steamer and your extraordinary
proposition," suggested Meade; "you say
that the man should actually die?"</p>

<p>"Surely die. And he should face death even
as our highly vitalized young friend here faces
life. Mr. Cadogan, coming back to us from perilous
experiences, makes us share with him in every
tremor, every dread, every thought he himself
felt in his adventure. And how does he manage
to do that? Isn't it because in the perilous moment
his soul remains tranquil? If death comes,
well and good&mdash;it cannot be helped; if not, then
a glorious adventure. He meets danger with
every faculty keyed up to the highest. Now, if
a man would meet his death, as this steamer went
down, in the same mood, would he not march
into the shadows with a soul ennobled?"</p>

<p>"And then what?"
<span class='pagenum'>[298]</span></p>

<p>"Then? If we are heirs in spirit even as in
body will God ever allow a great spirit to become
extinct?"</p>

<p>Meade abandoned his young-ladies'-teacher
supposition. He speared the man with another
glance. "Pardon me, you are not a scientist?"</p>

<p>Lavis smiled&mdash;for the first time. "Do I talk
like one?"</p>

<p>"You do not believe, then, in present-day scientific
methods?"</p>

<p>"I believe in any constructive method, but"&mdash;he
betrayed a shadow of impatience&mdash;"why limit
our beliefs to what can be proved with a surgeon's
knife?"</p>

<p>Meade thought he remembered that Roman
Catholic priests were on special occasions allowed
to travel without the outer garb of their calling;
but would a priest talk so freely to a stranger?
And yet&mdash;"You must have had a religious
training at some time in your life?"</p>

<p>Lavis smiled again, but more slowly. "You
are persistent, Mr. Meade."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon. It is the journalist's interviewing
habit. And I thought I recalled,
also&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lavis seemed to be waiting for Meade to finish,
but Meade, who suddenly realized to what
he was leading, did not finish; and Lavis turned
<span class='pagenum'>[299]</span>
his head so as to look squarely at Cadogan.
Through the half-closed, wistful eyes Cadogan
caught a gleam that he again felt was an answer
to Meade's unfinished question, and yet was again
meant, not for Meade, but for himself.</p>

<p>"But to return," persisted Meade; "how is
the world to benefit by your theory that God
does not allow a great spirit to die?"</p>

<p>"Well, call it theory. After the mortal death
of a man whose dying was a tremendous experience,
there will be born again a great soul. And
if the being in whom that soul is enshrined is
but true to the best in himself, he will attain to
the utterance of a great message, compel the world
to listen to his message; and the world, having
listened, will be for all time the better."</p>

<p>"I suppose"&mdash;Meade was by now not wholly
free of self-consciousness&mdash;"a man should have
had a training as a writer to best fit him for such
an experience?"</p>

<p>"Writer, sculptor, painter, musician, lawgiver&mdash;anything,
so that he possesses the germ, the
potential power to make others see, hear, or feel
things as he does."</p>

<p>"But who aboard this ship possesses such a
gift?"</p>

<p>Lavis turned to Cadogan. "Here is the man."</p>

<p>"Who!" Cadogan bounded in his seat; and
<span class='pagenum'>[300]</span>
then, smiling at himself: "That's a good one&mdash;I
took it seriously."</p>

<p>"Take it seriously, please."</p>

<p>Cadogan instantly sobered. "But I'm not
aching to die. And the Lord never intended me
for a martyr."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you know what the Lord intended
you for? You have done great deeds in
one way. You could do great deeds in another
way. A great deed is never more than a great
thought in action. You need but the great
thought to give the great deed birth."</p>

<p>"But I never originated a great thought in
my life."</p>

<p>"What man ever did? The seeds of great
thoughts are born in us, which means that they
come from God. But great deeds are man's.
And if it should come to pass in your adventurous
life that you go to a calamitous death, it
may not be altogether a pity. If your heart remains
pure as now, it surely would not be. You
have every qualification, if you could but be born
again."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't you yourself be the man for
such a thing?" It was Meade, eying the man
from under contracted eyebrows, who put this
question.</p>

<p>"Thanks!" Lavis's smile was almost perceptible.
<span class='pagenum'>[301]</span></p>

<p>"I did not mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No harm. It would require the creative genius.
I am no longer creative."</p>

<p>"But you have an intellect."</p>

<p>"Meaning that I have a well-developed muscle
in the brain? The man who lifts heavy weights
in the circus has also a well-developed muscle in
his arm, or back, or legs, but what does he teach
us that is for the betterment of the race? But
Mr. Cadogan here has the flaming soul. And the
last passenger on this ship should be such as he,
a strong man with the innocence of the child." He
turned from the older to the younger man. "You
are creative in thought, powerful, direct, tireless
in action, Mr. Cadogan. Every new experience
still comes to you with the dew of the morning
on it. You should die hard, with your eyes open
to the last. Nothing would escape you. And
you would know what dying was, because for
you to give up life would be a great renunciation."</p>

<p>Cadogan shook his head. "Even if all the
rest of it were true, I have nothing in life to
renounce."</p>

<p>"How can you know that? You would be renouncing
a limitless capacity for enjoyment, if
nothing more." Lavis rose to his feet. "I hope
I haven't bored you too much? I think I will
go out and get some fresh air." He bowed and
<span class='pagenum'>[302]</span>
smiled to Meade, smiled more warmly on Cadogan,
wrapped his top-coat over his evening clothes,
and went out on deck.</p>

<p>Meade saw that Cadogan was gazing thoughtfully
on the seat which Lavis had vacated.
"What do you make of him, Cadogan?"</p>

<p>Cadogan's face, when he swung his chair around,
was flushed, his dark-blue eyes more glowing than
usual. "I don't know, except that he had me
thinking. He made me feel that he was reading
my mind, and before he left I was saying to myself,
'When I grow older I'll be something like
him,' only, of course, with less brains than he's
got."</p>

<p>"You'll have brains enough, don't fear. He
made me think of the head of a religious order
who went wrong some years ago. But that was
before I knew much of the inside of Continental
affairs. A woman, as I recall it. However, he's
gone&mdash;he made my head ache trying to follow him,
and&mdash;but there is the major and Vogel passing
the port-hole. I'll call them in and we'll have
our little rubber."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They sat in to their little rubber, and while
they played a passenger of importance was auctioning
off the pool on the ship's run for the next
day.
<span class='pagenum'>[303]</span></p>

<p>He stood on a table to see and be seen, a short,
fat, bearded man who sometimes had to pause for
breath. "Here she is, gentlemen, the largest
ship of all time making marine history. What
d'y' say, gentlemen? We all know what we did
up to noon to-day. We did even better, impossible
though it may seem, this afternoon. Now,
what am I offered for the high field? Come now,
gentlemen. By Tuesday morning, at ten o'clock,
are we to be abreast of Sandy Hook or not? It
will be a record run if we make it, but whether
we are a few minutes late or early, every indication
points to a grand day's run for to-morrow.
Come, gentlemen, bid up!"</p>

<p>"What of the rumors of icebergs?" asked a
voice.</p>

<p>"Pray do not joke, gentlemen. I beg of you,
do not joke. Has any person here observed any
notice of icebergs posted on the ship's board? I
fancy not. To-day I myself put the question to
the man whose word is law on this ship. Do I
have to name him, gentlemen? No need, is
there? No. 'Are we going to slow down?' was
my question. 'On the contrary, we are going to
go faster,' was the reply."</p>

<p>There was a laugh. "Seventy pounds!" was
called.</p>

<p>"That's the spirit, gentlemen. Seventy pounds
<span class='pagenum'>[304]</span>
for the high field. The gentleman who shall be
fortunate enough to win this pool will have something
to brag about in future days. Come, now,
how much for the high field? Seventy-five?
Good! Gentlemen, I am offered&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the high field worth, Cadogan?"
asked Vogel.</p>

<p>"All you want to bid, if nothing goes wrong.
But with ship's officers spending more time with
distinguished passengers than on the bridge, I
wouldn't give a nickel for it."</p>

<p>"I won't bid, then."</p>

<p>The voice of the man on the table was increasing
in volume. "Eighty-five pounds I am offered
for the high field. It is not enough, not enough
by far, gentlemen&mdash;eh! Eh, I say."</p>

<p>The ship heaved, not violently; gently rather,
under them. There was an easy, slight roll to
port, a dull, almost noiseless bumping, a slow,
heavy resistance, as of a heavy object being
forced over a stubbornly yielding surface.</p>

<p>To either side of him and in the mirrors Cadogan
could see a dozen men peer inquiringly up
over cards or books or glasses. Meade stared
around the room. "What the devil's that?" he
asked, and held a card high, with eyes directed
to the nearest deck door.</p>

<p>There was a recoil of the ship, which slowly
<span class='pagenum'>[305]</span>
and gently, but surely and almost comically, to
Cadogan's way of thinking, urged the stout waist
of Meade against the edge of the table.</p>

<p>Cadogan waited his last turn to play, laid down
his card, and scooped in the trick. "Forty on
points, eight on honors, Major," he said, and set
it down. "If nobody minds, I'll step out on
deck and see what stopped her."</p>

<p>"Stopped! Is she stopped?" exclaimed Vogel.</p>

<p>"She is." Cadogan strolled out of the smoking-room.
Three or four had preceded him; half a
dozen, who had nothing else to do, strolled out
after him.</p>

<p>In a few minutes those who had gone out were
beginning to return. "Well, what do you know
about that?" whooped the first one. "Hit a
lump of ice! Lucky for the ice we didn't hit it
fair, with this forty-five-thousand-tonner going
along at twenty-five or six knots an hour like
she is!"</p>

<p>Several laughed at that, and Major Crupp, who
was patiently riffling the cards, called out to the
last speaker: "Did you see Mr. Cadogan out
there?"</p>

<p>"I saw him going toward the bow of the ship,
Major," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Investigating, I suppose. Well, suppose we
play dummy&mdash;what do you-all say?&mdash;till Caddie
<span class='pagenum'>[306]</span>
comes back. He's possessed of a demon for finding
out things. Your deal, Mr. Vogel."</p>

<p>A steward stepped in from the deck. "Major
Crupp, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Cadogan told me to say not to wait till
he came back, sir, but to go on with the game, sir."</p>

<p>Vogel picked up his cards. "How long will we
be delayed, steward?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not more than an hour or two, they say,
sir."</p>

<p>"H-m-m"&mdash;Vogel stared reflectively at the
table&mdash;"I'll have to buy Cadogan a good smoke
when he comes back. He saved me ninety or a
hundred pounds on that high field."</p>

<p>They resumed play.</p>



<h3>II</h3>

<p>Lavis was pacing the wide promenade deck
and sniffing the air as he paced. It was as if a
breath of the north were on them, and yet&mdash;having
reached the uncovered part of the deck astern
he looked up to observe the steamer's smoke&mdash;the
wind was not from the north.</p>

<p>Such passengers as were still making their
rounds were doing so determinedly, in sweaters
or top-coats. Without halting in their rapid walking
<span class='pagenum'>[307]</span>
they, too, at times drew short, sharp breaths
through high-held nostrils. It surely was growing
colder. But why? A group held up an officer
who was smoking his pipe in the lee of the canvas
forward to ask him why. He at once set them
right about it. Why, surely it should be cool&mdash;on
the North Atlantic, in April, and well on in
the evening!</p>

<p>A couple that Lavis knew for bride and groom
turned out to lean over the rail. He was pointing
down by the ship's side. "Hardly a ripple on
it&mdash;see!" he exclaimed. "Only for the bubbling
up from underneath, none at all. Like an endless
belt sliding by so smoothly, isn't it? And
above&mdash;see, sweetheart&mdash;a clear sky."</p>

<p>"Ah-h, a beautiful night!" she murmured.
"On such a night&mdash;" Lavis, as he turned the
corner of the house, saw him snatch her close and
kiss her.</p>

<p>In lounge and smoking rooms all was cosey,
cheerful, lively company. Lavis in passing had
only to glance into air-ports to be sure of that.
It was card-playing and easy gossip in the one,
and not infrequent drinks being brought to impatient
men by alert, deferential, many-buttoned
servants in the other. In the grill those who
must have a special little bite before turning in
were having it; and, this being a chilly sort of a
<span class='pagenum'>[308]</span>
night, there were those who were also having a
warming drink, with the bite or without it.</p>

<p>It was growing late. The deck was now almost
deserted. Lavis took a last look over the rail, a
last gulp of the cooling air, and went into the
loungeroom. Here he got from the steward paper
and envelopes, sat down and wrote:</p>

<blockquote>Now see that you make no attempt to lure him back</blockquote>.

<p>There was no address, no signature. He sealed
the envelope and went below to where, at the
end of a passageway, he found a stewardess on
watch. "Miss Huttle hasn't come down yet,
Hannah?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, Mr. Lavis."</p>

<p>"No? Well, there is a party in Mr. Drissler's
suite."</p>

<p>"Mr. Drissler, sir?"</p>

<p>"The wealthy man in the royal suite."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Miss Huttle is there. You take this note to
her there, and let me know that it has been delivered,
please."</p>

<p>Lavis went to his room, got out a long, loose
linen duster from his wardrobe, removed his top-coat,
pulled the duster over his evening clothes,
found an old cloth cap, and waited for the return
of the stewardess.
<span class='pagenum'>[309]</span></p>

<p>She came presently. "I gave it to Miss Huttle,
Mr. Lavis. Into her own hand, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Hannah."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lavis left his room and descended deep down
into the ship, to where a man in dungarees, but
with an officer's cap of authority, was perched on
a horizontal grating poring over the speed register.
Over his shoulder Lavis watched the numerals
shift&mdash;seven, eight, nine, thirty. One,
two&mdash;eight, nine, forty. Click, click, click, click&mdash;he
watched them until the officer turned and
saw him.</p>

<p>"Ho, I was beginning to think you'd given me
the go-by for to-night." They shook hands.</p>

<p>"Isn't it the most beautiful mechanism ever
made by the hand of man!" exclaimed the officer.
"A watch is nothing to it. And what
you see here cost more than twenty thousand
watches&mdash;twenty thousand of 'em, and every
danged watch in a gold case."</p>

<p>He drew out his own gun-metal stop-watch.
"I'll time her now for a hundred revolutions."</p>

<p>He caught the time, set it down in a little notebook,
and from it slowly but surely reckoned her
speed. "Grand, grand!" he said softly. "Will
you come along? Good!"</p>

<p>They descended and ascended many narrow
<span class='pagenum'>[310]</span>
iron ladders and made their way through many
narrow, grimy passageways. Oilers, stokers, coal-passers,
water-tenders straightened up to give
them a greeting as they passed. In one boiler-room
a stoker was scooping a dipper through the
water-pail at his feet as they entered.</p>

<p>"Are we holding our own this watch, Mr. Linnell?"
He held the dipper respectfully in suspense
for the answer.</p>

<p>"Holding it? Yes, and more."</p>

<p>"Hi, hi! an' that gang went off watch before
us, Mr. Linnell&mdash;an' I fancy they rate themselves
a competent watch&mdash;among themselves, sir&mdash;they
threw it at us as how we'd do mighty well to hold
our own." By this time his chief had passed
on, but Lavis, lingering, saw the stoker gulp a
mouthful of water, hold it a moment, and squirt
it, <i>s-s-t!</i> contemptuously into a heap of hot ashes.</p>

<p>Linnell continued his rounds, sparing a nod here;
a nod there, almost a full smile at times, and at
times, too, a sharp snap of criticism. Lavis in
his rear caught the pursuing comment. He was
the kind, was the chief, to soon let you know
where you stood. And right he was. And no
one would begrudge him what he could make of
the passage, if so be he could make a bit more of
reputation out of it, for surely his heart was in
his work. Never one to loaf, by all reports, but
<span class='pagenum'>[311]</span>
this time!&mdash;not a single watch without his full
rounds below.</p>

<p>Lavis followed the engineer up a narrow iron
ladder, and thence up a wide iron ladder, to where,
from a heavily grated brass-railed platform, Linnell
surveyed his engines.</p>

<p>He laid a hand on Lavis's shoulder and extended
an eloquent arm. "Worth looking at,
aren't they? The largest engines ever went into
a ship, those engines you are looking at now,
Mr. Lavis. It is something to have charge
of the likes of them. Wait till I see some of my
old mates!" His was a low, chuckling laugh.
"I'll be having a word to say, they better believe,
of ship's engines! Talking of their ten and
twenty thousand tonners&mdash;ferry-boats, river ferry-boats,
that's what I'll tell 'em they have alongside
o' this one. And everything working beautifully"&mdash;he
hesitated a moment&mdash;"leastwise in
my division. An' why shouldn't it, Mr. Lavis,
after four days and three nights now of never
closing an eye for more than two hours together?
But two nights and another day now, an' 'twill
be all behind us. And something to put behind
a man, that&mdash;a record-breakin' maiden passage
of the greatest ship ever built. And&mdash;but I'm
gassin' again. We'll be moving on."</p>

<p>Lavis followed Linnell to where a man in grimy
<span class='pagenum'>[312]</span>
blue dungarees was standing silent watch. Before
him was a row of levers and beside him a
dial on which were words in very black letters:
<span class="smcap">Full Speed, Half Speed</span>, and so on. To one
side was a disk around which two colored arrows,
one red and one green, were racing. A gong was
at the man's ear. At his feet was a pit into
which a great mass of highly polished steel was
driving in and out, in and out, up and down
ceaselessly.</p>

<p>Linnell studied the colored arrows as they sped
around the disk. "Port engine a bit the best of
it?" He had to speak into the man's ear to make
himself heard.</p>

<p>The man in dungarees nodded. "A wee bit,
sir."</p>

<p>"How's all else?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't be better, sir." He had to yell to
make himself heard. "Are we holding our own,
sir?"</p>

<p>"A full revolution better than any watch since
we left port."</p>

<p>The man nodded as if he had been expecting it,
but presently chuckled and swung one foot playfully
toward the glittering gray cross-head as it
went driving down into the pit. "A full revolution!"
he echoed&mdash;"t-t-t"&mdash;and spat with obvious
significance into the pit.
<span class='pagenum'>[313]</span></p>

<p>"T-t-t&mdash;" mimicked Linnell, and slapped him
lightly on the shoulder before he turned to Lavis.</p>

<p>"Will you go farther or wait here?"</p>

<p>"I'll wait here, if you don't mind, and stand
part of the watch with Andie."</p>

<p>"Very good! I'll pick you up later."</p>

<p>Lavis, standing beside Andie and gazing into
the pit, pointed to the great cross-head driving by.
"If that were to fly out and go through the bottom
of the ship, Andie, would it sink her?"</p>

<p>Andie projected his lower lip. "It <i>might</i> sink
her, sir, though it don't seem possible-like. But
if it <i>did</i> sink her, 'twould be <i>about</i> the only way
<i>to</i> sink her, sir."</p>

<p>Lavis let his eyes roam above and about
him. Andie observed the direction of his gaze.
"A wonderful sight, aren't it?" he commented.
"What wi' so many polished rods an' shafts all
whity-gray, an' all them many beams an' bars
so beautiful green an' red-painted!"</p>

<p>Lavis, still interested in the wonderful machinery,
felt the deck lifted the least bit under him.
It was as if the ship had risen to a rolling head
sea. He laid hold of a handy stanchion to steady
himself, but he saw Andie, unsupported, go sliding
easily, gently, irresistibly to the bulkhead behind
them. Lavis saw Andie brace his legs, and
then, remindful and resentful, bound back to his
<span class='pagenum'>[314]</span>
station and set a hand to each of two levers.
The iron deck beneath them was still rolling easily;
from beneath the deck came a chafing noise,
a slow, heavy grinding.</p>

<p>Lavis saw that with hands to levers, eyes on
indicator, and ears to gong, the man in dungarees
had become oblivious to all but the expected
order from the bridge. It came after a time&mdash;the
warning clang and the needle pointing to
<span class="smcap">Astern Slow</span>.</p>

<p>Andie shifted his levers. Rods and shafts reversed.
Andie, eyes set on the bridge dial,
waited.</p>

<p>Lavis could hear Linnell's voice sharply hailing
somebody in the boiler-room passage. Presently
he saw him running by the bulkhead door; and
then, from the far end of the passage, his voice
cracking out like a whip: "Back, I say! Back,
you dogs, back to your stations! I'll tell you
when you're to go."</p>

<p>He came bounding in and past Lavis and
Andie, up the narrow iron ladder, up the wider
one above it. Again Lavis heard him: "You
thought to forelay me, eh&mdash;and breed panic
above? You misbegotten spawn, I'd kill you as
I'd kill a cockroach&mdash;and every last one of you,
if you force me. You dogs&mdash;go back!"</p>

<p>Cries and oaths, then the thud of a heavy
<span class='pagenum'>[315]</span>
weapon on bone and flesh, the falling of stumbling
bodies on the iron grating above. A silence,
and then Linnell's voice again, now more controlled:
"You there, Wallace? Well, stay there.
An' let not a single one of 'em pass without my
orders. Shoot 'em down if you have to, but keep
'em below."</p>

<p>The ship was still backing. <i>Wh-r-r-i-ng!</i> went
the gong. Stop! commanded the indicator. Andie
shifted the levers. The tremendous machinery
hung motionless.</p>

<p>All was quiet. Not a quiver from out of the
great compartment. Through the grating over his
head Lavis saw the figure of the chief hurriedly
descending. He saw him turn, pause a moment
at the head of the narrow ladder, and then come
sliding down.</p>

<p>"Doing our best, some of 'em will get up above,"
he said quietly. "But we've enough left for a
watch." He stepped to Andie's side, all the
while with his eyes roaming over the machinery.
"She answered her bells promptly, Andie?"</p>

<p>"To the stroke, sir."</p>

<p>"Good! Stay by her. Pass the word to me
if aught goes wrong."</p>

<p>He was through the bulkhead door and into
the passageway before he had completed the
order.
<span class='pagenum'>[316]</span></p>

<p>Lavis saw Andie pout his lower lip, and with a
"T-t-t&mdash;" shift his gaze to the pit. "The blind
bats!" burst from him, and he spat into the pit.
"See there, sir!" he called out to Lavis.</p>

<p>Lavis nodded. He had already noticed it.
There was a foot or so of water in the pit.</p>

<p>"How the devil came it there?" Andie stooped
and scooped a handful of it, tasted it, and
held it up for Lavis to view. "Salt! <i>And</i> cold.
T-t-t&mdash;" Andie let his breath whistle softly
through his parted teeth.</p>

<p>The water was rising. By and by it was over
the top of the pit and crawling across the shiny
deck. Andie looked about for relief.</p>

<p>"I'll tell him," volunteered Lavis.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. An' you might say, sir,
there must be somethin' wrong wi' the bulkhead
doors. They aren't closed yet."</p>

<p>Lavis met Linnell returning in the passageway.
"Buttons in place of eyes in their heads aloft!"
he was muttering. "An' for all o' forty mechanics
brought specially to set things right, they can't
close the doors below."</p>

<p>Together they waded in to where Andie was
now to his knees in water. "Let be your levers,
Andie, an' take a spell o' rest for yourself," commanded
Linnell.</p>

<p>Andie slowly relaxed his fingers, pulled a bunch
<span class='pagenum'>[317]</span>
of waste from his hip pocket, and wiped his
hands.</p>

<p>"She's hard hit," said Linnell to Lavis, "though
there's few know it yet. And won't in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Then I'd better be going above?"</p>

<p>"That's right, do. Will you be back this way
again?"</p>

<p>Lavis let his hand rest lightly on Andie's head.
"I'm not sure." He extended his hand to Linnell.
"If I don't see you again, good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. Lavis." The engineer stepped
closer and whispered: "If any honest chance offers
to leave the ship, leave her."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Lavis found his way through the crew's quarters
to the lowest sleeping deck of steerage. Here
a few old people and some children, too discouraged,
too indifferent, or too helpless, were clinging
to their bunks. On the next deck he found a
gathering in the open space surrounding a freight
hatch. One whom he knew for a Polish woman,
with her baby at her breast, was on the edge of
the crowd, and, like most of the others, glancing
up to see what was doing on the higher decks.
The Polish woman was too concerned with her
baby to see exactly what they were doing on that
high deck where all the boats were, but another
woman was telling her how it was.
<span class='pagenum'>[318]</span></p>

<p>Lavis stepped closer and listened. She was
telling, the tall one, how there were many men
running about excitedly&mdash;ship's men with only
shirts above their trousers some, and others with
coats buttoned up. And they were pulling and
hauling and knocking away blocks. Such a clear
night one could see them&mdash;see their forms&mdash;and
hear, too, their blows and shouts. The woman
with the baby nodded. Without looking up she
could hear the blows. And now the electric light
had come, resumed the tall one; she could see
that many women had gathered there, and some
were pushing forward and others pushing back,
and now women&mdash;yes, and a man&mdash;were being
put into a boat.</p>

<p>"And now the boat is lowered," resumed the
tall one.</p>

<p>"I can hear them," said the young mother.
"And now it is rowing away from the ship in the
dark."</p>

<p>"And there is another," informed the tall one
by and by.</p>

<p>"I can hear that, too, rowing away in the dark.
And from the water&mdash;do you hear it, too, baby&mdash;such
a lonesome cry in the darkness?"</p>

<p>At that moment Lavis spoke to her in her own
language. The young mother greeted him warmly.
"Ah-h, baby," she said, "here is the good gentleman
<span class='pagenum'>[319]</span>
who lives in the country where your father
is waiting." She turned from the baby to ply
Lavis with rapid questions in Polish.</p>

<p>What did that mean&mdash;the boats leaving the
great ship? Surely it must be true what the
men had said, the ship's men&mdash;that there was
no danger? Surely it must be true that such a
monster of a ship, it could not sink? Surely it
could not! And yet why were all the rich ladies
being sent away and the gates to the upper decks
closed, so that the poor people in the steerage
could not get out? Was it really true there was
no danger? Surely those officers would not deceive
poor, friendless people! And yet here the
oily men, the greasy ones who worked deep down
in the ship, rushing every moment from below!
And saying nothing but low-spoken words to each
other, and into their rooms and out again in no
time, but with more and heavier clothes upon
them! Did men dress more warmly to work where
the engines and hot fires were?</p>

<p>"Wait. I will return," said Lavis to her, and
stepped over to where two stewards were on
guard over a gate. One, observing him, turned
to the other and remarked, with vast negligence:
"A silly lot, steerage, ain't they? Always airin'
a growl about something or other, as if ship's
rulin's was a-goin' to be changed for the likes o'
them!"
<span class='pagenum'>[320]</span></p>

<p>"I would like to get to the upper deck," interrupted
Lavis.</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> would like to get to the upper deck,
would you? And who, may I ask, do you take
yourself for, a-trying to speak like a toff?" The
man turned his back to Lavis. "Swine!" he repeated
to his mate.</p>

<p>Lavis glanced down at himself. He had overlooked
the effect of the old linen duster and the
old cap.</p>

<p>"When <i>he</i> gets to 'arbor, of course there will
be tugboat visitors and customs officers arskin'
for 'im, won't they?"</p>

<p>The other cast half an eye on Lavis. "When
the clarss will look down on the tops o' their
heads and remark: 'What a mob of 'em there!
How many of 'em did you cart along this time,
Captain?' I fancy he'll have only to cock his
ear up to hear 'em."</p>

<p>"Bloody foreigners, most of 'em."</p>

<p>Lavis returned to the Polish mother. "Come,"
he said. "There is another way out of here."</p>

<p>"Please, sir, the big, jolly Irisher&mdash;what is she
saying?"</p>

<p>Lavis listened to the big, jolly Irish girl, who,
however, was not now so jolly. Lavis had seen
a thousand like her gathering kelp on the west
Irish coast&mdash;tall, deep-bosomed, barefooted girls
with black hair to the waist, and glorious dark
<span class='pagenum'>[321]</span>
eyes. She was standing on the covered hatch,
and pointing at the moment to one of the ship's
men who had passed.</p>

<p>"Wet to his knees. Where is it he should be
getting wet to his knees? And another one.
And where is it they are going? And is it we
that has to stay here till that kind"&mdash;she pointed
to the two stewards on guard at the steerage
gate&mdash;"are pleased to let us out? Haven't we as
much right to our lives as them that lives higher
up? Five hundred of us here, women and childther,
and which of them above cares whether we
live or die?"</p>

<p>She pointed to a woman with her brood clinging
to her hands and skirts. "Look at that poor
woman with her five childther. And that poor
little thing"&mdash;she indicated the Polish woman&mdash;"that
has a husband waiting for herself and her
baby in New York. And that other one, and
that one, and that one. God in heaven, mothers
with their children to their breasts, and not to
be given a chance to live at all! If 'tis a mother
I was, and a child to my breast, it's not images
of men in uniforms would hinder me from saving
my baby this night! And myself with my baby,
if my baby was in need of me, an' I could."</p>

<p>The two ship's men on guard were gazing, not
at the steerage, but up at the higher decks,
<span class='pagenum'>[322]</span>
when a dozen or more of the steerage women
swept across the deck. "Grand work for strong
men," the Irish girl cried, "preventin' poor women
and childther from looking out for themselves.
It's not even shadows of men ye are!" and with
that bowled the near one over; and her companions,
sweeping up behind her, bowled the other
one over. The two stewards had a look up and
a look down, and then, with an outraged look at
each other, they flew after the disappearing steerage
women.</p>

<p>"Come, now." Lavis took the Polish mother's
hand.</p>

<p>"Sh-h!" she warned. "He is sleeping."</p>

<p>Lavis, nodding that he saw, helped her carefully
to her feet, and led her through the now unguarded
gate, and by way of several ladders, to that high
deck where the boats were.</p>

<p>A boat was all but ready for lowering. The
last woman had been crowded into it. The Polish
woman removed her shawl and wrapped it around
her baby. "Baby!" Lavis could hear her saying
over and over again in Polish. "Oh, my baby!
my baby boy!" but softly, so as not to waken
him. She stepped into the circle of light which surrounded
the boat and the ship's people. "Sa-ave
beb-by," she said in English, and held shawl and
baby up at the end of her outstretched arms.</p>

<p>A rough hand gripped her by the shoulder.
<span class='pagenum'>[323]</span></p>

<p>"Stand back! Stand back, you! You've no right
here! Saloon goes first, don't y' understand?"</p>

<p>She stepped back in discouragement.</p>

<p>The men, busy at the falls, had swung the boat
clear and were about to lower away. "Now!"
said Lavis sharply in her ear, and pointed to the
boat.</p>

<p>"Ah-h," she murmured, and darted under the
arms of the ship's men and thrust her baby into
the bosom of the nearest woman in the life-boat.
"Save beb-by!" she breathed, and darted
back into the crowd.</p>

<p>"I meant yourself also," said Lavis reproachfully.</p>

<p>"No, no, no&mdash;they would take baby, but me&mdash;no."
Her eyes followed the lowered boat.</p>



<h3>III</h3>

<p>When Cadogan went forward he wished to see
something other than the loom of the low-lying,
misty, white berg against the sky. He peered
down over the bow. He bent low his ear to
catch the purr of eddying waters.</p>

<p>He turned sharply on his heel, and went below&mdash;deep
below.</p>

<p>When he reappeared he went straight to his
stateroom. Here, in the cabin sleeping quarters
<span class='pagenum'>[324]</span>
below the promenade deck, nothing disturbing
had happened. When such passengers as were
about to turn in became aware of that slow lurch
and easy stoppage, they had stepped out into the
passageways, and asked each other what was the
matter; which question was answered almost
immediately by ship's people who came hurrying
among them with reassuring words. "It's nothing,
ladies and gentlemen. If you will go back
to your rooms, ladies and gentlemen&mdash;it's nothing."
And they had gone back to their rooms.</p>

<p>Cadogan turned on the light in his room, and
hauled out his suit-case. He found a pad of
paper, found also a fountain pen, shook the pen
to make sure there was ink in it, let down the
covering of the wash-basin for a desk, laid thereon
a small photograph of a beautiful face and head
<i>en profile</i>, and began to write. He set down
"Dear," and paused. He smiled faintly, wrote
"Helen" after it, and went unhesitatingly on:</p>

<blockquote>This afternoon, over our tea, as I concluded one of my
almost endless monologues, you may remember you said,
"You'd better watch out or some day you will be having
your last adventure." Well, I have had it. Not with this
ship&mdash;no, no. My last adventure was a dream of you. I
was on the dock, about to board a steamer for South America,
when I saw you step out of your cab. And so I came aboard
here. I am glad I came.<br />

You brushed me in passing, as I stood beside the gangplank
trying not to stare at you; but you did not know that&mdash;did
<span class='pagenum'>[325]</span>
you?&mdash;although for an instant I thought you did. It
was the conceit of youth, that thought.</blockquote>

<p>Cadogan held up his pen. The sound of hurrying
feet from the passageway, the noise of fists
pounding on doors, of high-pitched voices asking
and answering questions, broke on his ears. He
listened, stared at the air-port for a moment, and
resumed his writing:</p>

<blockquote>About this time a steward is pounding on your door and
<i>hin</i>forming you that you are to go on deck and be ready to
go into the boats. Nothing serious, he is probably saying.
The poor man who tells you so, I am sure, does not suspect,
but whoever told him to carry that message knew better.
Perhaps it is just as well he does not suspect.<br />

When the steamer stopped that time, it was because she
struck on the submerged shelf of an iceberg. In three hours&mdash;or
less&mdash;she will go down, and all who happen to be on
board will go with her. They should be able to stow a thousand
women and children in the boats, and these should be
picked up soon after daylight, if the sea stays smooth and
the weather clear. To-night's indications were clear weather
and a calm sea for at least another day, so that will be all
right.<br />

You will be in one of the boats, and&mdash;safe. It would be
like you not to want to go. If I hear that you do not, then
some one will see that you do go. But I shall not be by
you when you leave the ship, for I do not want you to read
in my face that I know I am not to see you again&mdash;nor to
bother you in any way. I shall be looking on as you leave,
and what you said to-night will not then matter. As you
go over the side my prayer will go with you</blockquote>.

<p>There came a sharp knock on the door.</p>

<p>"Come!" he called. It was his own steward,
<span class='pagenum'>[326]</span>
who thrust his head past the door's edge. "Saloon
passengers are to go on deck, Mr. Cadogan."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I 'ave no idea, sir. Orders, sir. I was to hinform
the saloon passengers as how they were to
go on deck, and women and children into boats."</p>

<p>"All right. Thank you. And, Hames."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"You hunt up Miss Huttle's maid, and have
her tell Miss Huttle to be sure to wrap up warm.
Be sure she gets that right&mdash;to wrap up warm.
Two sets of everything all round. Got that
right?"</p>

<p>"Two sets&mdash;yes, sir."</p>

<p>"That's all, Hames."</p>

<p>"'K you, sir."</p>

He resumed writing:

<blockquote>And so it has come to write the adieu which I would dread
to have to speak. Four days only have I known you, but
a man may build his life anew in four days, and this last
adventure of mine has been such as in my visionary boyhood
days I used to mark out for myself in rosy dreams.<br />

I have the little snapshot you gave me yesterday. I will
have it with me to the end, and your face in it will be the
last thing I kiss this side of eternity. And so good-by, dear
heart, and don't worry for me. Who lives by the sword, et
cetera. It had to come to some such ending, I suppose,
though rather a joke, isn't it, to be lost on an ocean liner
crossing the Atlantic in these days?<br />

To-day with you I saw the sun go down 'twixt purple bars,
and what is the little matter of dying to that? And it is a
<span class='pagenum'>[327]</span>
consolation to know you will not mourn me. Good night,
dear heart, and may God have ever a tender eye on you.</blockquote>

<p>He sealed the envelope, and very carefully addressed
it: "Miss Helen Huttle," placed it in his
inside coat-pocket, kissed the little photograph,
and placed that also in his inside coat-pocket.</p>

<p>He gazed about to see what else. His top-coat
lay where he had last thrown it&mdash;across the edge
of the berth. He shook his head at it, and from
his wardrobe took a heavy ulster, scanned it approvingly
and put it on. He hauled his steamer
trunk out from under his berth, and from a corner
of it dragged a thick wallet. He ran his thumb
along the edge of the bills within it. Large banknotes
they were mostly. He stuck the wallet into
his hip pocket. The handle of a magazine pistol
peeped up at him. He took it up, laid it flat in the
palm of his hand, shook his head, and tossed it
back. He took one more look around the room,
waved his hand to the walls, and stepped out into
the passageway.</p>

<p>A hurrying steward almost bumped into him.
It was Hames. "Miss Huttle was told, sir."</p>

<p>"Good! Now, something else. Later on Miss
Huttle will be going into a boat. Before she goes,
be sure you give her this letter. Not now&mdash;no.
But up on deck, just before she goes."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."
<span class='pagenum'>[328]</span></p>

<p>Cadogan sought the upper deck by way of the
second-cabin quarters. On the wide staircase he
overtook an old couple who, at sight of him,
began talking volubly. She was a little old lady
with a confiding smile, and he a bent and round-backed
man with a long, forked beard.</p>

<p>"Vot you t'ink, Mr. Cadogan? He tell me I
shell go in der boads."</p>

<p>"And why not, Mrs. Weiscopf?"</p>

<p>"Und vere shell he go?"</p>

<p>"A man of Mr. Weiscopf's age&mdash;they may let
him go with you."</p>

<p>"I go in der boads?" The old man tried to
straighten up. "I shell not go in der boads. I,
mit childrun und grandchildrun, to go in der
boads? It is der foolishness&mdash;all der foolishness&mdash;dose
boads."</p>

<p>"Why, then, shell I go in der boads, Simon?"</p>

<p>"For mens I say der foolishness. All der
womans go in der boads, Meenie."</p>

<p>"I shell not go in der boads mitout you, Simon."</p>

<p>"Go in the boat, and take him with you, if
you can, Mrs. Weiscopf," whispered Cadogan,
and hurried on.</p>

<p>He came onto the boat-deck in the rear of the
saloon passengers already gathered there. The
first boat was clear. An officer stood at the
<span class='pagenum'>[329]</span>
stern of it. "Women and children!" he was calling
out, and there was a rush to fill it.</p>

<p>"I don't see many children," said a voice.</p>

<p>"Do you ever&mdash;in saloon?" retorted another.</p>

<p>Cadogan, recognizing the second voice as
Meade's, and seeing that he was also in the rear
of the crowd, stepped over beside him.</p>

<p>The boat was filled, and lowered in jumps and
jerks. The passengers moved to the next boat.
Half a dozen ship's men and an officer stood by.</p>

<p>"They're taking enough of the crew along,"
observed Meade.</p>

<p>"Not much gets by you," commented Cadogan.</p>

<p>"It's my business. I'll have to write a story
about this later."</p>

<p>"Women and children!" called the officer.</p>

<p>The boat was filled, except for a space for
ship's men and the officer in charge, who stepped
quickly in. This boat went down likewise in
jumps and jerks.</p>

<p>In the next boat two men passengers jumped
in at the last moment. The officer in charge
seemed not to see them. The crew said nothing.</p>

<p>"Must have friends at court," muttered Meade.
"Though why anybody should choose the staying
out all night, half frozen, in those boats I don't
understand, do you? But look&mdash;there's the Major
marshalling his battalions. Old ladies and young,
<span class='pagenum'>[330]</span>
pretty and otherwise&mdash;instinctively gallant, the
Major," observed Meade.</p>

<p>"We'll remember your friends in New York,
Major!" two of the younger ones chorussed.</p>

<p>"Be sure you do!" he retorted. "And pay
your bet with a box of candy when you're back
aboard in the morning. But take care you keep
those rugs around your feet in the meantime."
He waved them smilingly down the side of the
ship, but he was not smiling when he had turned
his back to the ship's side, and made his way into
the crowd of passengers.</p>

<p>Cadogan shrank back of Meade. It was Miss
Huttle who had stepped into the light, with Drissler
in attendance. And not alone Drissler. She
was fully dressed, with heavy furs in addition.
Her smile was not less frequent, and apparently
her tongue no less ready than usual, when she
replied to the sallies of her escorts.</p>

<p>The blocks were knocked away clumsily, the
falls overhauled bunglingly for the next boat.
Cadogan ached to jump in and show them how
to do it.</p>

<p>"The worst of standing here, Meade"&mdash;Major
Crupp had taken his position by the side of the
journalist&mdash;"is that no matter how matters are
handled, we can no more interfere than if we
were children in steerage. And yet some of
<span class='pagenum'>[331]</span>
us, Cadogan here especially, could help out a
lot."</p>

<p>"Why can't you jump in there and help?"
inquired Meade.</p>

<p>"Discipline. A man whose trade calls above
all things for discipline must be the last of all to
interfere with it. There's an officer there foolishly
displaying a revolver, frightening people needlessly.
Some foolish woman&mdash;did you hear her?
&mdash;just said: 'How brave!' Brave! When his
boat is loaded he goes off with it."</p>

<p>"Well, he's welcome, Major. I wouldn't care
to be out there all night. What do you say,
Cadogan?"</p>

<p>Cadogan made no answer. He was not losing
a finger's crook of Miss Huttle's actions; and
yet he was listening to and studying Meade and
Crupp, old Mrs. Weiscopf and her husband, the
ship's officers and men, a steerage woman with
her baby in a shawl&mdash;however she came to be
there&mdash;everybody and everything within sight
and hearing. He could not help it. If he were
one of a file of prisoners to be taken out and
shot, his last curiosity would be to know what
everybody was saying and doing&mdash;the executioners,
the executed, himself, the spectators.</p>

<p>He noted the parting of bride and groom, and
wondered what that groom would have given to
<span class='pagenum'>[332]</span>
go with her into the boat. He was taking note
of the women who went reluctantly from the sides
of their men-folk, and those who could hardly be
held back until their turn came. He studied the
faces of the men who by some mysterious dispensation
were allowed to go into the boats. Some,
as they stepped under the cluster of electric lights,
betrayed to him that they knew. Some one in
authority had told them, or, like himself, they
had found out for themselves.</p>

<p>It was then that he saw Lavis. A woman
with a baby in the shawl had, with a sublime
gesture, abandoned her baby to a woman already
in the boat, so that it might be saved. Lavis
was standing behind her when she did it, and as
she lost herself in the crowd, Lavis had looked
after her with such an expression of pity that
Cadogan's attention was attracted anew to him.</p>

<p>When Lavis turned to the circle of light again,
his eyes met Cadogan's. "And you, too, know,"
thought Cadogan. Lavis came over to him.</p>

<p>"I was wishing I could give that poor woman
this big coat of mine," began Cadogan; "it might
make things a little less miserable for her."</p>

<p>Lavis's eyes thanked him. "I will find her and
give it to her." Cadogan took it off. "I will
see you again," said Lavis, and,went off with
the coat.
<span class='pagenum'>[333]</span></p>

<p>Cadogan turned in time to see&mdash;and it thrilled
him&mdash;old Mrs. Weiscopf refusing to go when her
turn came. She pointed to the old man. "No,
no," was the impatient answer from the officer.
"But he iss so old," she pleaded again. She
was roughly told to hurry up and get into the
boat or stay behind. She marched back to her
old husband, and gripped him tightly by the arm.
The boat left without her.</p>

<p>Cadogan saw these things, and a hundred
others, without ever losing sight of Miss Huttle.
On the other side of the ship he knew that a
gang of ship's men were fighting for the possession
of a boat for themselves. He could hear
them&mdash;half-smothered murmurs, cries, blows. He
thought of going to his room, and getting his
automatic pistol, and jumping in among them.
But what good would it do? was his next thought.
It would be only to substitute one set of dead
men for another; and, doing it, he would lose
sight of her.</p>

<p>At last she walked over to where the boat was
ready to lower. Before she stepped in she cast
a long look above the heads of the crowd. The
thought that she might be looking for him set
Cadogan to trembling. She was pale. He drew
farther back into the shadows. He saw her face
peering out again from the crowded hats, toques,
<span class='pagenum'>[334]</span>
and hoods of the close-packed women as the boat
was lowered.</p>

<p>She appeared to be still searching for some one
in the crowd as the boat disappeared below the
deck rail. Cadogan forced his way to the rail to
watch it. It was rolled from side to side, bumped
against the ship's side, swung in and out as it
descended. While yet some distance above the
water, it stuck. Cadogan could just make it out.
The falls had fouled. With a jerk the stern
dropped several feet on the run, and the boat
hung again in air, now with bow up and stern
down. There were screams and shouts. Cadogan
was at the rail, ready to leap, when the bow
unexpectedly dropped. The boat was level again.
It was in the water and floating. She was safe
away.</p>

<p>Cadogan remained by the rail, tracing the
course of the little boat on the sea. When he
could no longer see the shadow of it, nor hear
the voices from it, he still stayed, pursuing in
his imagination her course and position out there
on the waters.</p>

<p>When he faced inboard, all the boats were
away, and Meade and Crupp were no longer on
deck. He guessed they had gone into the smoking-room.
<span class='pagenum'>[335]</span></p>



<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Many other passengers had returned to the
smoking-room by the time Cadogan got there.
Meade, Crupp, and Vogel were already seated at
the corner table. Cadogan sat down with them.</p>

<p>From the farther corner of the room came a
strident voice. "They were all of them foolish
to go at all, that's what I say. They will be out
there all night, and in the morning we will be
laughing at them when they return aboard. See
here. Please see here."</p>

<p>The speaker opened and held up an illustrated advertising
booklet. No one in the room could fail to
see it. "Thirty-eight water-tight compartments.
See, there it is. Non-sinkable. Non-sinkable&mdash;that's
the word. See for yourself, whoever cares.
But there's people who fancy they know more
about ships than the men who make a trade of
building 'em." He stared around the room to
see who would gainsay him. Nobody seemed to
care to.</p>

<p>Crupp turned around to see who it was. "It's
that chap was auctioning off the ship's pool an
hour or two ago," explained Vogel. "He never
stops."</p>

<p>Major Crupp's questioning eyes roamed from
<span class='pagenum'>[336]</span>
Cadogan to the assertive man at the farther
corner and back to Cadogan. "What d'you make
of him, Cadogan?"</p>

Cadogan shrugged his shoulders. "It is faith
like his that builds empires. And stupidity like
<p>his that loses them."</p>

<p>The man with the booklet had not abated the
fervor of his reading announcements; but those
who were listening were listening without comment.
Thus far no one in the room had spoken
aloud of danger except the man with the booklet.
The effect of his loud insistence was to increase
the unvoiced uneasiness.</p>

<p>A steward, with a face into which a white
frost seemed to have bitten, burst into the smoking-room,
revolved rapidly once in the middle of
the room, and vanished through the door by
which he came.</p>

<p>Everybody turned toward the door through
which he disappeared, and then every head
seemed to turn toward every other. The voice
of the man with the booklet was lowered. Presently
he ceased reading.</p>

<p>One man stood up and went silently out. The
door closed behind him. Another stood up.
One, two, three men followed him to the door.
Several got up together. Another group was on
its way when suddenly there was a rush for the
<span class='pagenum'>[337]</span>
door. The man with the booklet, whiskered, fat,
and red-necked, stared down at his printed page
in amaze. He gulped, blinked, heaved himself
up, and lumbered after the others. Only the
four gathered around the corner table remained
in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>Crupp, with his thumbs hooked into his trousers
pockets, was staring down between his knees. On
Crupp's left was Vogel, the millionaire of the railroads.
He was a tall, slope-shouldered man of
fifty-five, bald at the top of his head. His forehead
sloped back from speculative eyes. "Hi,
wake up there, Major!" he bawled, most unexpectedly.
"That steward who came running in
that time, you'd think he thought the ship was
going down. What d'y' imagine he wanted,
Major?"</p>

<p>Crupp raised his head and stared abstractedly
at Vogel. "Huh," repeated Vogel, "what was he
after, Major?"</p>

<p>"Lord knows"&mdash;Crupp suddenly smiled&mdash;"perhaps
it was a tip."</p>

<p>On the table was a siphon of soda and some
empty glasses. Crupp selected one that had not
been used, and, carefully gauging, poured about
an inch of soda into the glass. "The ship going
down, Mr. Vogel? Heroes then we'd have to
be"&mdash;he glanced at each in turn over the rim of
<span class='pagenum'>[338]</span>
his glass&mdash;"whether we liked it or not, wouldn't
we? What did you learn that time you went
forward, Cadogan?"</p>

<p>Cadogan also helped himself to some soda-water,
rolled it around in his mouth, swallowed
it, and set down his glass. As if he had not
heard Crupp, he drew out his cigar-case and offered
it to the soldier.</p>

<p>Crupp nodded his thanks, took a cigar, bit off
the end, and, without looking away from Cadogan,
lit up. Vogel took one, but as if by way of
courtesy only, for he indicated no desire to light
it. Meade, waving Cadogan away, lit a cigarette
of his own rolling. "Shortening my life smoking
cigars," he explained.</p>

<p>The door opened. It was Lavis. With a pause
and a bow, as if to ask their permission, he took
the corner seat on the transom. Cadogan, waiting
until he saw Lavis seated, tendered him the
cigar-case. Lavis shook his head.</p>

<p>"If you're afraid it's my last&mdash;" suggested
Cadogan.</p>

<p>"It's years since I've smoked."</p>

<p>"That saves me, for it <i>is</i> my last." With the
word Cadogan threw the empty cigar-case on the
table.</p>

<p>Meade picked up the case, a gun-metal one,
with Cadogan's monogram in thin, flat silver letters
<span class='pagenum'>[339]</span>
on the side. "You throw that down, Cadogan,
as if you wanted to give it away."</p>

<p>"Did it look that way?" Cadogan took it
from Meade's extended hand. "I've carried that
a good many years." He stood up as he finished
speaking, to reach for some matches from the
next table. After lighting up he remained standing.</p>

<p>"Clear, settled weather, and a smooth sea."
He was gazing reflectively through the weather
air-port as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Cadogan"&mdash;Meade was speaking&mdash;"give us
some more of your adventures."</p>

<p>Cadogan drew out his watch, also of gun-metal.
"And I've carried that a good many years, too."
He spoke as if to himself. He looked at the face.
"No, it's too late, Mr. Meade. It's too late to
begin now."</p>

<p>"It's never too late. Just think, in your short
life you have lived more volumes than I have
written. You know more, ten times more, about
real life than I do, and I'm sixty. I wonder"&mdash;he
fanned the smoke from him&mdash;"would you mind
dying after all you've been through?"</p>

<p>Cadogan was still standing. He set his left
foot on the seat of his chair, his left elbow on his
knee, and his chin in the heel of his left hand.
By extending two long, supple left fingers he could
<span class='pagenum'>[340]</span>
hold his cigar while he blew rings of smoke toward
the air-port. He blew them now&mdash;once,
twice, three times. "I don't know any healthy
men who are eager to die, do you?" he said, half
smiling, presently.</p>

<p>"Meaning you don't want to go yourself?"</p>

<p>"Just that. And yet, if I had to go, any time
now, I don't see where I could have any kick
coming. Somewhere, sometime, it had to come.
And yet I was wondering, only to-night, queerly
enough&mdash;" Between the first two fingers and
thumb of his right hand he was somersaulting
the gun-metal cigar-case against the table-top.
<i>Tap</i>&mdash;<i>tap</i>&mdash;<i>tap</i>&mdash;
one end, then the other&mdash;<i>tap</i>&mdash;<i>tap</i>&mdash;
<i>tap</i>&mdash;it went.</p>

<p>While Cadogan paused Meade was making
mental notes of him. How wide and powerful
the shoulders loomed, how trim the waist, the
grace of the long white fingers, the smooth curves
of the strong face, all brown below the eyes and
all white above! "What a fight you could put
up!" thought Meade. "And what a pity if anything
should happen to you before you should
have had your chance!"</p>

<p>Cadogan ceased somersaulting the cigar-case.
"Wouldn't it be queer, now, I was thinking&mdash;here
I've drawn lots with Death a hundred times&mdash;a
few more or less&mdash;and then to think of him
<span class='pagenum'>[341]</span>
coming along and grabbing a fellow off the deck
of an ocean liner!"</p>

<p>"That <i>would</i> be a joke," commented Meade.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it?" Cadogan carefully knocked
his cigar-ashes onto the tray. His eyes and
Crupp's met.</p>

<p>With his eyes now focussed on the ash-tray,
Cadogan continued: "If I have left anybody
worrying, or guessing, I can tell him where there
is a collapsible life-boat which will be safe in smooth
water."</p>

<p>"There are women still aboard," said Crupp.</p>

<p>"Eh, what's that?" Meade sat straight up.</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;Cadogan's response was directed to
Crupp&mdash;"there are many women aboard. But
when that life-boat is launched, there is going to
be a grand fight to see who will get on it. A
half-dozen armed men could hold it for themselves,
but not for anybody else&mdash;women or men.
What do you say, Major? Would you be for
that kind of a fight in the event of her sinking?"</p>

<p>Crupp shook his head firmly. "I'd better
shoot myself&mdash;or any other army or navy officer
&mdash;than be saved where a ship-load of women went
down."</p>

<p>"What do you say, Mr. Vogel?"</p>

<p>Vogel smiled uneasily. "You gentlemen of the
sword and pen, how you do try our nerve at
<span class='pagenum'>[342]</span>
times! But in my circle neither do men honor
the craven. With many women still aboard,
would I get into a boat and leave the ship? Why,
no."</p>

<p>"Do you mean, Cadogan"&mdash;all was silence
when Meade spoke up&mdash;"do you mean there is a
possibility that this ship will founder?"</p>

<p>Cadogan nodded&mdash;twice&mdash;slowly.</p>

<p>"But for God's sake, when?"</p>

<p>"See"&mdash;he pointed to the deck at their feet&mdash;"the
slant. Her bow is settling now."</p>

<p>No one spoke, and only Meade moved, and he
to interlock his fingers and, pressing his hands
together, to rest them on the edge of the table,
and lower, for a moment, his head.</p>

<p>Only Cadogan seemed to remember that Lavis
was on the transom seat. During all the time
that he was speaking and acting, Cadogan knew
that Lavis had never ceased to study him.</p>

<p>Cadogan addressed him directly. "The raft?"
asked Cadogan. Lavis shook his head indifferently.</p>

<p>The soldier dropped the butt of his cigar straight
down between his knees. Meade laid the ends of
his fingers on the edge of the table, and stared at
his nails.</p>

<p>Vogel sat a little higher in his chair. "Well,
there's one thing. For three generations now
<span class='pagenum'>[343]</span>
our family have pursued a constructive policy.
My son is almost of age. I hope he will not forget
his responsibilities."</p>

<p>Major Crupp stood up. "Shall we go outside?"</p>

<p>Vogel stood up promptly. Meade got more
slowly to his feet. "It doesn't seem real," he
said to Cadogan; "so quiet! Do men die so
easily?" Without waiting to hear the answer he
walked after Crupp and Vogel.</p>

<p>Lavis had not moved from his transom seat.
Cadogan walked half-way to the door and returned.
"You set me thinking to-night, Mr. Lavis, but
I see now that it is you the Eternal Verities should
select to go down into the depths."</p>

<p>"No, no! Never immortality for me. I had
my chance. I threw it away. I was dedicated
to a sacred calling, Mr. Cadogan. I had almost
achieved the heights, when I&mdash;fell. I sinned not
only in body, but in spirit. To sin in body is to
scorch the soul; but to sin in spirit is to consume
the soul. Mine is but ashes. Yours is still
a burning flame. And&mdash;but there is somebody
at the door, I think, who wishes to speak to you."</p>

<p>It was a man in a steward's uniform. As
Cadogan reached the door, the man retreated
to the shadows of the deck. Cadogan followed.
It was Hames, with a square envelope in his
hand. "Miss Huttle, Mr. Cadogan," he whispered,
<span class='pagenum'>[344]</span>
"said I was to give you this. When there
was nobody about, she said, sir. I've been trying
ever since, sir, to find you alone."</p>

<p>Cadogan stepped to the light of a smoking-room
air-port, held the sheet close up to the
glass, and read:</p>

<blockquote>It was all a mistake after dinner to-night. I will explain
when next we meet&mdash;if ever we do meet. But you must see
that we do meet. You must. The passengers do not know,
even you may not know, but it is true&mdash;the ship is going to
sink. I am frightened&mdash;dreadful thoughts&mdash;if you were only
near!<br />

You must save yourself. You can, if you will. You can
do the impossible. You have done it before in play. Do it
to-night for the woman who loves you.<br />

I know you will never go into the boats, but after they are
gone, when you can no longer help another, I ask you to save
yourself&mdash;save yourself not for yourself, but for me.<br />

A woman who loves&mdash;remember you said it yourself&mdash;hers
is the call that no man has the choice of refusing. A woman
who loves you and whose love is all for you, will be calling
calling, calling, as you read this, from out on the dark sea.<br />

Come, come, come, O Beloved, to me at the last. If you
do not come, I shall believe always that you did not care.
But I know you will come to me. <span class="smcap">Helen</span>.</blockquote>

<p>Cadogan stared at the sea about him, at the sky
above him. He rubbed his forehead. "'Come,
come, oh, come!'" he murmured. He drove his
clinched fist against the air-port. "I'll come!
I'll come!"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cadogan?" It was the steward.</p>

<p>"What is it?"
<span class='pagenum'>[345]</span></p>

<p>"There's queer talk going about between decks,
sir. There will be desp'rate work doing to-night,
if what they say is true, sir. I've a family
in Southampton, sir, and I always tried to do my
duty, sir."</p>

<p>"I never knew a better steward, Hames. Listen."</p>

<p>"'K you, sir. Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"On the boat deck for'ard, port side&mdash;get that
right now."</p>

<p>"Port side for'ard, sir. Yes, sir. Believe me,
sir, I won't forget such directions as you are
pleased to give, sir."</p>

<p>"There's a collapsible life-boat there under a
tarpaulin. Somebody is saving that for the finish&mdash;for
a favored few."</p>

<p>"I believe you, sir."</p>

<p>"Stand by it, and when they launch it jump on."</p>

<p>"But they will have spanners and wrenches,
and such weapons, sir."</p>

<p>"They surely will. In the steamer trunk in
my room you will find a magazine pistol."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. 'K you, sir."</p>

<p>"But you must hurt nobody, mind, except
those who try to hurt you."</p>

<p>"I'll promise, sir. An' I'll remember also I
'ave a missus an' three kiddies in Southampton,
sir."<span class='pagenum'>[346]</span></p>

<p>"And don't forget you have them, either."</p>

<p>"No, sir. 'K you, sir. But I never 'andled a
magazine one. Any complications, sir?"</p>

<p>"Not many. You find the trigger, curl your
finger around it, put the muzzle to the man's
head who means you harm, and, if he persists,
pull the trigger. It's very simple."</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you. And don't forget&mdash;you
keep pressing the trigger as long as you want to
keep shooting. And&mdash;how old are the kiddies?"</p>

<p>"Five, and three, and the baby, one. A grand
little chap, the baby, sir."</p>

<p>"Is he now? Isn't that fine!" Cadogan drew
from his hip-pocket the wallet with the packet of
bills. "Put this in the bank&mdash;for the kiddies and
missus."</p>

<p>"It's a hawful kindness to 'em, sir."</p>

<p>"All right. Good luck to you."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you, I s'y, sir." He vanished.</p>



<h3>V</h3>

<p>From his seat on the transom, Lavis had caught
sight of the face of Cadogan as he read the sheet
of paper held up to the air-port. His chin came
down on his chest, remained there a moment, and
then he stood up and slowly went out on deck,
<span class='pagenum'>[347]</span>
by way of the door opposite to that which Cadogan
had taken.</p>

<p>The passengers were gathering thickly on the
top deck. There was now no restriction, ship's
people having ceased their supervision, and many
steerage passengers were crowding up to join first
and second class on the higher decks.</p>

<p>"In the last death plunge," mused Lavis,
"steerage may go first, if so be it pleases them."</p>

<p>He made out a couple standing hand in hand
like children. He knew them, the couple from
second cabin, and of the faith of the prophets of
old.</p>

<p>"For why should I go in der boads, Simon?"
the woman was saying. "No, no, mein husband.
Fifty yahres together we hafe been now. Together
we shell go now also."</p>

<p>"Surely God will welcome thee," murmured
Lavis, and touched their clasped hands in passing.</p>

<p>He halted. A young man was staring out on
the wide sea. Lavis remembered the bride and
groom who had been so rapturously gazing out
on the sea together before the collision. This
was the groom, and he was speaking to another
young man who was treading the deck restlessly,
four paces one way, four paces back. "They
said there was a lantern in the boat she was
put in. I think I see it&mdash;a small light."
<span class='pagenum'>[348]</span></p>

<p>"Do you?"&mdash;the restless one halted&mdash;"I don't.
How long were you married?"</p>

<p>"Four months."</p>

<p>"Oh-h! We were only ten weeks." With
short, quick steps he resumed his striding.</p>

<p>Lavis leaned beside the young man at the rail.
"I think I see the light you were looking for&mdash;there."
He pointed.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;that's it. See here!" He turned
to address the pacing man. "Why, he's gone!"
He peered into Lavis's face. "There were ten of
us, you see, with our wives, returning from our
wedding trips. We were going to have a supper
together when we reached New York."</p>

<p>"But you are not afraid?"</p>

<p>"I am. And I wish I could have gone in the
boat too. But look there!" He pointed to the
hundreds of steerage passengers who were still
crowded together three decks below. "What
chance did they give those women to-night?
what chance do they ever get? And my old
mother came over steerage. And she is still alive.
And she would stand me up before her and she'd
say&mdash;I know how she would say it: 'Dannie, boy,
do you tell me you came away from a sinking
ship, and women and children behind you?'"</p>

<p>"But you are not sorry?"</p>

<p>"God, man, no! But only the night before last
<span class='pagenum'>[349]</span>
my wife all at once came close to me and said:
'Dannie, we're going to have a little baby.' And
nothing more for a long time, me holding her. And
then she whispers: 'And I hope he'll be a boy,
and grow up to be a man like you, Dannie,' she
said.</p>

<p>"And God help me! Already I had him grown
up and was taking him out to see the Giants play."</p>

<p>"God help us all!" said Lavis; and gripped the
other's hand swiftly, and passed on to the lowest
open deck, where, by way of the long gangway,
he might reach the after end of the ship. Already
the deck was taking on a more noticeable forward
slant. He saw a man lashing together some chairs.
He paused long enough to see that it was Cadogan,
but, without discovering himself, he passed on to
where an isolated man in dungarees leaned with
folded arms across the rail.</p>

<p>It was Andie, with his chin resting on his arms,
and his face turned toward the placid sea. Once
he lifted his head to gaze up at the sky.</p>

<p>Lavis touched him on the arm. "How did
you leave Mr. Linnell, Andie?"</p>

<p>Andie unfolded his arms and faced around.
"Eh? Oh! How do you do, sir? He comes to
me, Mr. Lavis&mdash;an' 'twas somethin' beyond the
fear o' death was in his eyes&mdash;an' he says: 'Andie,
your work's done. 'Twas her death-blow they
<span class='pagenum'>[350]</span>
give her, an' she'll not live much longer now.
Go above you now, Andie,' he says, 'and I'll stay
here.' 'If you don't mind, I'll stay with you, sir,'
I says. 'Don't be foolish, Andie,' he says.
'There's small reputation goes with eight pounds
in the month. There's none will be lookin' in
the papers to see did you desert your post, but
there's many will be sayin' what a grand fool you
was you didn't go when you could.'</p>

<p>"'I know you mean that, sir, for the wharf-rats
that ships an' shirks for one voyage, and stays
drunk ashore for three more,' I says. 'I've no
call to leave this ship while one passenger is aboard
of her. An' more, Mister Linnell, many an'
many's the watch I've stood under you, an', 'less
you forbids it, I'll stand this last watch wi' you.
Only, if you won't forbid me, sir, I'll go up on
deck at the last, an' have a look at God's own
sky before she goes.'"</p>

<p>"And what did he say to that, Andie?"</p>

<p>"He said naught to that, sir, excep' to shake
hands wi' me. I was that embarrassed wi' the
grup o' the hand he gave, I takes out my pipe an'
baccy from the locker where the sea wasn't yet
reached to, an' I cuts myself a pipeful an' lights
up. An' he says, smilin'-like: 'Andie, is it the
same old Buccaneer brand you're smokin'?' An'
I says: 'The same, sir.' 'Well,' says he, 'I've
<span class='pagenum'>[351]</span>
always maintained it was the most outrageousest-smellin'
baccy ever was brought into an engine-room.
An' I won't change my opinion now,
but if you will spare me a pipeful I'll risk my
health to ha' a smoke wi' you now, Andie.'</p>

<p>"An' while we was smokin', sir, man to man
like he says: 'Andie, did ever you get it into your
head you'd like to be marryin'?' And I answers,
'I did, sir,' an' I told him o' the Brighton lass I'd
once courted, unobtrusive-like, between voyages,
goin' on two year, and I would 'a' been most
pleased to marry her, till of an evenin' we was
sittin' out by the end o' the long pier, wi' the
little waves from the Channel cooing among the
pilin's where the long skelps o' sea-grass was
clingin' to 'em under the planks at our feet.
She was a doctor's wife's maid. An' I axed her,
an' she says: 'The marster, an' my missus, too,
says when ye're gettin' your twelve pound in the
month, Andie, I'm to marry you.'</p>

<p>"'Wherever will I be findin' twelve pound in
the month?' I says. 'Your danged old doctor
himsel' is collectin' but little more nor that of his
bills in the month, him wi' his red herrin' an'
oatmeal porridge for breakfast every mornin' of
his life!' I says. She'd told me herself o' the red
herrin'. An' I left her clickin' her fancy high
heels together under her penny chair, an' I'd paid
<span class='pagenum'>[352]</span>
tuppence each for the two of us at the gate comin'
in. 'But you wasn't ever thinkin' o' gettin' marrit
yourself, Mr. Linnell?' I says.</p>

<p>"'Maybe you noticed a large photograph,
Andie, above my desk whenever you come to
my room?' he asks. I said as how I did. 'And
you had no suspicions?' he says. 'Well, sir,' I
says, 'I did make suspicion it wasn't altogether
by way of exercisin' o' your muscles you dusted
the gold frame of it so frequent.'</p>

<p>"'I was only waitin',' he says, 'till I'd made a
bit more reputation, and only to-night it was,
me makin' my rounds, that I was thinkin' at last
I had made it.' And he stop there, an' lets his
pipe go out the while he looks down at his beautiful
engines, an' then he has the loan of another
match of me, an' he says: 'Andie, but it
does seem hard that your life an' mine must be
smashed through the misbehavior of others.' An'
I thought myself it was, without meanin' to cast
blame, sir, on others.</p>

<p>"An' we finished our pipeful together, an' he
stands up an' says, 'Good luck to you, Andie, lad,'
and I knew he was wishful to be alone. An' so,
'Good luck to you, Mister Linnell,' I says, an' we
gave each other another long grup o' the hand.
I was wantin' to tell him he was the best chief
ever I worked under, but he wasn't ever the kind,
<span class='pagenum'>[353]</span>
you see, sir, to be praisin' to his face. An' at
the top of the ladder I looks down, an' there
he was wi' his arms folded across the shiny brass
railin', an' he lookin' down, aweary-like, at his
engines."</p>

<p>Lavis took Andie's hand. "A good man, Andie.
And a good man yourself, Andie. Good-by,
and God bless you!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Good-by, sir. And the same
to you." Andie turned to the rail and with folded
arms set his face to the impassive sea.</p>

<p>Lavis passed on to where from a tarpaulined
hatch a Catholic priest was saying a litany, while
around him a body of kneeling men and women
were responding. He had donned his cassock,
and a shining silver crucifix was on his breast,
and his biretta at his feet. His voice was even
and unhurried, his features composed.</p>

<p>"Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of
the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Spare us, O Lord!</i>" came the response.</p>

<p>"Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of
the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Graciously hear us, O Lord!</i>"</p>

<p>"Lamb of God, Who takest away the sins of
the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Have mercy on us!</i>"</p>

<p>"Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God&mdash;&mdash;"
<span class='pagenum'>[354]</span></p>

<p>"<i>That we may be made worthy of the promises of
Christ!</i>"</p>

<p>The priest rose from his knees. "And bear in
mind, my children, that no matter what sin you
may have committed, God will forgive you. No
one born into this world of sin but has sinned
at some time, so do not despair. Offer up your
prayers, your heart, to God. He will hear you.
He could save us, any one of us, or every one of
us even now, if he so willed. If he does not, it
is because it is better so. But merely to be saved
in the body&mdash;what is that? A passing moment
here, but the next world&mdash;for eternity. It is your
soul, not your body, which is to live in eternity.
Prepare your soul for that. And now our time is
growing short, compose your minds and your
hearts, and all kneel and say with me an act of
contrition: O my God&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>O my God</i>&mdash;" came from them like a chanted
hymn.</p>

<p>"I am most heartily sorry for all my sins&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>I am most heartily sorry for all my sins</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lavis knelt and prayed also. When he rose
from his knees it was to go to the side of the
Polish woman, who was also kneeling at the edge
of the crowd. He found her weeping.</p>

<p>"Why do you weep? Do you fear death so
very much?"
<span class='pagenum'>[355]</span></p>

<p>"I weep for my baby."</p>

<p>"But your baby is safe&mdash;out there in the boat.
They will bring him to his father, who will be
there waiting on the dock in New York."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but who will be there to give him
the breast when he wakes?"</p>

<p>"Who will give&mdash;Father in heaven! Come&mdash;come
with me." Lavis helped her to her feet.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Cadogan looked into the smoking-room. Lavis
was gone. He hesitated, wheeled quickly, returned
to the deck, sought the nearest gangway,
and rapidly descended four decks. He traversed
one passageway, another, and entered what looked
like a carpenter's shop, where, he knew, was a
thick-topped wooden table with its legs held by
small angle-irons to the wooden planking over
the steel-deck floor.</p>

<p>Cadogan crawled under the table, hunched his
shoulders, straightened his legs, and had the
table up by the roots. He stepped out from
under it, grasped it across the beam, raised it
high, brought two of the legs down against the
deck, once, twice; reversed the ends and brought
the other two legs down to the deck, once, twice.
The legs were gone.
<span class='pagenum'>[356]</span></p>

<p>He set the table top on his head. A man
stood in the doorway. Cadogan motioned him
out of the way. "Where yuh goin' with that?"
snarled the man. Cadogan set the end of his
plank against the man's chest, walked straight
ahead, and stepped over the man's body. In the
passageway some one seized his table from behind.
Cadogan let go entirely, wheeled sharply, caught
the man by the collar and trousers, smashed him
against the bulkhead, and, as the other dropped
his hold of the table top, threw him a dozen feet
down the passage. The man, rising to his feet,
ran the other way. Cadogan picked up his plank
and resumed his way.</p>

<p>At a place where a boat-falls dropped past the
ship's rail Cadogan laid down his burden. This
was on the lowest open deck, where not many
people would be coming to bother him; but, to
reduce the chance of loss, he set his table top up
on edge in the shadow of the rail, while he went
off for an armful of steamer chairs.</p>

<p>He needed lashings for his chairs. A transverse
passageway opened on to the deck near by.
Staterooms opened off either side of the passage.
The door of the nearest room was locked. "Bright
people," he muttered, "who didn't intend anybody
should steal anything while they were gone!"
He set one foot under the door-knob, rested his
<span class='pagenum'>[357]</span>
back against the bulkhead across the narrow aisle,
and straightened his leg. The lock gave way; the
door swung open. "When they return I hope
you won't miss the fine bed sheets," he murmured,
and swished them&mdash;one, two&mdash;from the
berths, with the blankets and one pillow. He
slit the hemmed edges of the sheets and tore
them into strips lengthwise. With these strips
he lashed his chairs compactly together. The
chairs in turn he lashed to the heavy plank.</p>

<p>Cadogan had taken off dinner coat, waistcoat,
collar, tie, and linen shirt to work more freely. Now
he looked about for the coat. All the while he had
been working he was not unaware that forms of
men had flitted by him, and that more than one
had stopped as if curious to know what he was
at. He knew that more than one of these were
now prowling within leaping distance and that
from them were coming muffled words of comment.
Also he was not unaware that the ship
was nearing her end. He could detect the first
pitching of her hull, the settling of the deck under
his feet, even as he could hear the half-tones of
the menacing voices from out of the shadows.
He was aware, too, that a despairing multitude
were massing on the decks above him.</p>

<p>Up there, he knew, they were preparing to
meet the end in a hundred different fashions.
<span class='pagenum'>[358]</span>
Up there would be those who smiled and those
who cried, those who joked or moaned, who
prayed or blasphemed, those who were going
with pity in their hearts and consumed with bitterness
others; forgiving whoever it was that had
brought it on, or wishing, the others, that they
had the negligent ones to coldly and calmly wring
their necks before they went themselves.</p>

<p>Cadogan, having found his coat, laid it on a
bitt near by while he should launch his little
raft. He balanced it on the rail, inserted a hook
under one of his lashings at each end, folded his
blankets on top, and, a boat-falls in each hand,
paid out carefully, slowly. He could not have
lowered a human body more tenderly. Easily,
gently, he felt it settle on the bosom of the sea.
He took a turn of his falls around the bitt, and,
always with one eye peeping sidewise into the
shadows, reached for his coat. In the pocket of
that coat was the photograph of his beloved.</p>

<p>"You've everything fixed nicely, have you,
matie?"</p>

<p>Cadogan had had his eye out for him, and was
expecting some such salutation; and the revolver
within two feet of his head was also not unexpected.
A man could not attend to everything
at once.</p>

<p>"Everything nice, yes," responded Cadogan,
now with his coat in his hand.
<span class='pagenum'>[359]</span></p>

<p>"I'm glad o' that, matie, because, you see, I'm
needing it."</p>

<p>"Would you take that from a man after all the
work he put in on it?" He was kneading the
coat into a ball in his right hand. With his left
hand he was taking in a hole or two in his belt.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> a soft un! And a swell toff, too.
You'll 'ave to st'y aboard, matie. I'm needing
that tidy little floatin' thing you've moored below,
and I'm plannin' to take it."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you take it?"</p>

<p>"No larkin'. I'm fightin' for my life."</p>

<p>"I've been fighting for more than my life, or
yours, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His right arm had been hanging loosely down
by his side. He snapped his right wrist against
his hip. The coat, in a tight ball, was jolted
into the man's face, just as Cadogan's left arm
shot up and caught the man's pistol wrist. His
open right hand followed the coat and gripped the
man's throat. He had no mind for a scuffle which
would attract attention, nor did he wish the man
when he dropped overboard to fall too near his
raft; so, with his finger to the man's windpipe, he
bore him along the passageway toward the stern
of the ship. The tide was setting that way. The
man was kicking out with both legs, striking out
with his free hand. Cadogan held the man's
arm over the rail the while he twisted the pistol
<span class='pagenum'>[360]</span>
wrist. The revolver dropped overboard. Cadogan
took a fresh hold of him, spun around with
him, and let him fly. He went where the revolver
went.</p>

<p>Cadogan, arrived back at his raft, found a man
standing by the falls and calling down to somebody
below: "How is it now?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. The man by the falls
repeated his question. Only silence from below.</p>

<p>Cadogan was looking for his coat, when the
man grasped the falls and swiftly lowered himself
over the side. Cadogan let be his coat and
slid down the falls after him. His feet fetched up
against the man's fingers. He pressed with all
his weight. The man cursed softly, let go his
hold, and fell into the sea. Cadogan dropped
after him. When the man came up Cadogan
gripped him by the throat and held him under
water.</p>

<p>The dim outline of another fellow was standing
erect on the end of the little raft. "Norrie, me
lad," he was saying in a cold voice, "it's a tidy
little floater with nice warm blankets, but it will
never hold up two." Cadogan could see a long
spanner, or bar, held ready on the shoulder of the
man on the raft. The man in the water was now
twining his legs about him, whereupon, still clinging
to his man, Cadogan dived, porpoise-like, head
<span class='pagenum'>[361]</span>
down into the sea. When he felt his feet under
he kicked once, twice, three times powerfully.
Deep down he went.</p>

<p>He came up alone.</p>

<p>He clung to one of the hooks of the falls to get
his breath. A cap floated up to him. Smiling
grimly, he set it on his head. The man on the
end of the raft poised himself above him and
aimed the long spanner at the cap. Cadogan diverted
the blow with his free forearm, and before
the other could recover wrenched the spanner
from him and dropped it into the sea.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! that's how it is, is it, Norrie, me lad?"
He swung one foot viciously at Cadogan's hand
where it was gripped around the hook. Cadogan
swooped again with his free hand, caught the man
by the swinging ankle, and hauled him off the
raft. He released his grip of the man's ankle,
only to shift it to his throat. The man seized
Cadogan's free wrist with both hands. Cadogan,
hanging to the hook with one hand and
gripping the man's throat with the other, continued
to squeeze the man's throat. The man's
legs kicked convulsively. Cadogan continued to
squeeze. When the legs stopped kicking, Cadogan
forced the head under water and eased up
on his grip. Bubbles rose up and burst on the
surface. Cadogan placed his ear close to the water
<span class='pagenum'>[362]</span>
to hear. When he could no longer hear the
bubbles he loosed his grip.</p>

<p>With hands to the falls and feet against the
ship's side, Cadogan climbed to the deck where
he had left his coat. He found it kicked to one
side and trampled upon. But the little photograph
was still there&mdash;in the inside pocket.</p>

<p>He took off his cap, the cap of the drowned
man, while he kissed the little photograph.
"Coming, coming, oh, coming!" he murmured.</p>

<p>"Have you room for a passenger?" came in a
man's voice from the dark.</p>

<p>Cadogan whirled. "Passenger? Passenger!
I've fought and schemed and&mdash;Oh!"</p>

<p>It was Lavis, and, clinging to his hand, was
somebody in a man's long ulster.</p>

<p>"It's the woman&mdash;you remember her?&mdash;who
passed her baby boy into the boat so that he
would be saved."</p>

<p>Cadogan said nothing.</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago I found her. She was
weeping for her baby. I asked her why she should
be weeping now that her baby was safe, and
she answered me: 'But who will be there to give
him the breast when he wakes?'"</p>

<p>Cadogan rested his left hand, with the fingers
clinched around the cap, on the ship's rail.</p>

<p>"If Christ on earth were to be with us once
<span class='pagenum'>[363]</span>
more," went on Lavis softly, "would he not say
again: 'Greater love hath no man than this'?
'Who will be there to give him the breast when
he wakes?'&mdash;and she about to die. Have you
room for her as a passenger on your raft?"</p>

<p>"It will bear only one."</p>

<p>Lavis waited.</p>

<p>Cadogan unloosed the fingers of the hand on
the rail. The cap dropped into the sea.</p>

<p>"She shall be the one," he said presently.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the rosy flush of a beautiful dawn a lone
woman on a tiny raft drifted down to her crying
baby and gave him suck.</p>
